  }
}
```

**Side Effects**:
- Sends targeted notifications to business and technical teams
- Creates support tickets for processing failures requiring investigation
- Updates processing failure tracking system
- Triggers automated recovery processes where applicable

### 4. Business Logic
**Processing Steps**:
1. Analyze processing failure context and determine business impact
2. Identify appropriate notification recipients based on entity type and failure stage
3. Generate detailed failure analysis with recovery recommendations
4. Create support ticket for failure investigation and tracking
5. Send notifications to business teams with business impact assessment
6. Send notifications to technical teams with technical details and recovery actions
7. Schedule follow-up notifications if failure remains unresolved
8. Update processing failure tracking system with notification status

**Business Rules**:
- **Entity-Specific Routing**: Notifications must be routed based on entity type and business domain
- **Business Impact Assessment**: High business impact failures require immediate business team notification
- **Recovery Guidance**: All notifications must include specific recovery actions and procedures
- **Ticket Creation**: Processing failures must create trackable support tickets for resolution
- **Follow-up Requirements**: Unresolved failures must trigger follow-up notifications after 2 hours

**Algorithms**:
- Business impact assessment algorithm based on entity type and processing stage
- Recovery action recommendation algorithm using failure pattern analysis
- Notification routing algorithm considering entity ownership and business domain

### 5. Validation Rules
**Pre-processing Validations**:
- **Processing Failure Data**: Verify all required failure information is complete and valid
- **Entity Validation**: Confirm entity type and ID are valid and accessible
- **Processing Stage**: Validate processing stage is within expected workflow stages

**Post-processing Validations**:
- **Notification Delivery**: Verify notifications have been sent to all required recipients
- **Ticket Creation**: Confirm support ticket has been successfully created
- **Recovery Actions**: Validate recovery actions have been properly documented

**Data Quality Checks**:
- **Failure Context**: Ensure failure context provides sufficient information for resolution
- **Recipient Validation**: Verify notification recipients are appropriate for entity type
- **Recovery Feasibility**: Check that recommended recovery actions are applicable

### 6. Error Handling
**Error Categories**:
- **VALIDATION_ERROR**: Invalid processing failure notification request
- **NOTIFICATION_ERROR**: Notification delivery failures
- **TICKET_CREATION_ERROR**: Support ticket creation failures
- **TIMEOUT_ERROR**: Notification processing timeout exceeded
- **ROUTING_ERROR**: Notification routing configuration errors

**Error Recovery**:
- Retry notification delivery with alternative channels for communication failures
- Manual ticket creation fallback when automated ticket creation fails
- Escalation to system administrators for critical notification system failures

**Error Propagation**:
- Notification failures are escalated to operations teams immediately
- Failed processing failure notifications trigger emergency communication protocols
- All notification attempts are logged for compliance and system monitoring

### 7. Performance Requirements
**SLA Requirements**:
- **Response Time**: 3000 milliseconds (95th percentile)
- **Throughput**: 200 processing failure notifications per minute
- **Availability**: 99.95% uptime

**Resource Requirements**:
- **CPU**: Moderate processing for failure analysis and notification generation
- **Memory**: 512MB for failure context processing and notification formatting
- **I/O**: Moderate I/O for notification delivery and ticket creation

**Scalability**:
- Horizontal scaling through distributed notification processing
- Performance scales with failure complexity and notification recipient count
