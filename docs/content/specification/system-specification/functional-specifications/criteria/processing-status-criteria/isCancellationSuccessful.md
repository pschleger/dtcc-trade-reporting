# Component Specification: isCancellationSuccessful

### 1. Component Overview
**Component Name**: isCancellationSuccessful
**Component Type**: CyodaCriterion
**Business Domain**: Processing Status Criteria
**Purpose**: Evaluates whether trade cancellation processing has completed successfully with all required authorizations and updates
**Workflow Context**: Used in cancellation processing workflows to determine if cancellation operations have been successfully completed

### 2. Input Parameters
**Entity Type**: CancellationProcessingResult
**Required Fields**:
- `cancellationId`: string - Unique identifier for the cancellation process
- `cancellationStatus`: string - Status of cancellation processing (SUCCESS, FAILED, PENDING, PARTIAL)
- `processingTimestamp`: string (ISO-8601) - When cancellation processing was completed
- `originalTradeId`: string - Identifier of the original trade being cancelled
- `authorizationStatus`: string - Status of cancellation authorization

**Optional Fields**:
- `impactAssessment`: object - Assessment of cancellation impact on positions and risk
- `approvalDetails`: object - Details of cancellation approval process
- `validationResults`: object - Results of cancellation validation checks
- `errorDetails`: array - Details of any errors encountered during processing

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `attachEntity`: boolean - Whether to attach entity to evaluation context
- `calculationNodesTags`: string - Tags for distributed evaluation nodes
- `responseTimeoutMs`: integer - Maximum evaluation time in milliseconds (default: 2000)
- `context`: string - Evaluation context identifier

**Evaluation Context**:
- Cancellation processing requirements and authorization criteria
- Business rules for successful cancellation completion
- Integration requirements with downstream systems and regulatory reporting

### 3. Evaluation Logic
**Decision Algorithm**:
```
IF cancellationStatus = SUCCESS THEN
    IF authorizationStatus = AUTHORIZED THEN
        IF impactAssessment.completed = true THEN
            IF validationResults.allPassed = true THEN
                RETURN true (cancellation successful)
            ELSE
                RETURN false (validation failures)
        ELSE
            RETURN false (impact assessment incomplete)
    ELSE
        RETURN false (authorization not obtained)
ELSE
    RETURN false (cancellation not successful)
```

**Boolean Logic**:
- Evaluates cancellation processing status for successful completion
- Verifies required authorization has been obtained
- Confirms impact assessment has been completed successfully
- Validates all required validation checks have passed

**Calculation Methods**:
- Cancellation status evaluation based on processing result
- Authorization status verification against business requirements
- Impact assessment completion verification

### 4. Success Conditions
**Positive Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Cancellation Status Success**: Cancellation processing status indicates successful completion
- **Authorization Obtained**: Required authorization for cancellation has been granted
- **Impact Assessment Complete**: Cancellation impact assessment has been completed
- **All Validations Passed**: All required validation checks have passed successfully
- **No Critical Errors**: No critical errors encountered during cancellation processing

**Success Scenarios**:
- **Standard Cancellation**: Trade cancellation processed successfully with proper authorization
- **Emergency Cancellation**: Expedited cancellation completed with emergency authorization
- **Bulk Cancellation**: Multiple trade cancellation processed successfully as a batch
- **Regulatory Cancellation**: Cancellation required by regulatory mandate completed successfully

### 5. Failure Conditions
**Negative Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Cancellation Status Failed**: Cancellation processing status indicates failure
- **Authorization Denied**: Required authorization for cancellation has been denied
- **Impact Assessment Incomplete**: Cancellation impact assessment has not been completed
- **Validation Failures**: One or more required validation checks have failed
- **Critical Errors Present**: Critical errors encountered during cancellation processing

**Failure Scenarios**:
- **Authorization Rejection**: Cancellation is rejected during authorization process
- **System Failure**: Technical system failure prevents cancellation completion
- **Validation Rejection**: Cancellation fails business rule or data validation checks
- **Incomplete Processing**: Cancellation processing is incomplete or partially failed

### 6. Edge Cases
**Boundary Conditions**:
- **Null Cancellation Result**: Handle cases where cancellation result is null or undefined
- **Pending Authorization**: Handle cancellations waiting for authorization
- **Partial Success**: Handle scenarios where some cancellation steps succeed but others fail
- **Timeout Scenarios**: Handle cancellations that exceed processing time limits

**Special Scenarios**:
- **Emergency Cancellations**: Handle expedited cancellations with different authorization requirements
- **Cross-System Cancellations**: Handle cancellations requiring coordination across multiple systems
- **Rollback Scenarios**: Handle cancellations that require rollback due to downstream failures

**Data Absence Handling**:
- Return false when cancellation result data is completely unavailable
- Apply conservative evaluation when required cancellation fields are missing
- Log warnings when critical cancellation information is absent

### 7. Performance Requirements
**SLA Requirements**:
- **Evaluation Time**: 500 milliseconds (95th percentile)
- **Throughput**: 1000 evaluations per second
- **Availability**: 99.95% uptime

**Resource Requirements**:
- **CPU**: Low processing for status evaluation and authorization verification
- **Memory**: 128MB for cancellation result processing and validation

### 8. Dependencies
**Internal Dependencies**:
- **CancellationProcessingService**: For accessing cancellation processing results
- **AuthorizationService**: For cancellation authorization status verification
- **ImpactAssessmentService**: For cancellation impact assessment results
- **ValidationService**: For cancellation validation result verification

**External Dependencies**:
- **Cancellation Database**: For cancellation processing result persistence (SLA: 99.9% availability)
- **Trade Management System**: For trade entity access and updates (SLA: 99.95% availability)
- **Authorization System**: For cancellation authorization management (SLA: 99.9% availability)

**Data Dependencies**:
- Cancellation processing configuration and business rules
- Authorization criteria and approval requirements
- Impact assessment thresholds and validation criteria

### 9. Configuration
**Configurable Thresholds**:
- `authorizationRequired`: boolean - Whether authorization is required for cancellation - Default: true
- `impactAssessmentRequired`: boolean - Whether impact assessment is required - Default: true
- `requiredValidations`: array - List of required validation checks - Default: ["business_rules", "regulatory", "risk"]

**Evaluation Parameters**:
- `allowPartialSuccess`: boolean - Whether to allow partial success scenarios - Default: false
- `timeoutToleranceMs`: integer - Tolerance for processing timeout - Default: 5000
- `emergencyBypassEnabled`: boolean - Whether emergency bypass is allowed - Default: false

**Environment-Specific Settings**:
- **Development**: Relaxed authorization requirements for testing
- **Production**: Strict authorization and validation requirements

### 10. Error Handling
**Evaluation Errors**:
- **DATA_UNAVAILABLE**: Cancellation result data not accessible
- **EVALUATION_TIMEOUT**: Evaluation exceeded timeout period
- **CONFIGURATION_ERROR**: Invalid evaluation configuration parameters
- **SYSTEM_ERROR**: Technical evaluation failure

**Error Recovery**:
- Return false (cancellation not successful) when cancellation data is unavailable
- Apply default configuration when evaluation parameters are invalid
- Log evaluation errors for monitoring and troubleshooting

**Error Propagation**:
- Evaluation errors are logged with full context and cancellation details
- Critical evaluation failures trigger monitoring alerts
- Failed evaluations are tracked for system reliability assessment
