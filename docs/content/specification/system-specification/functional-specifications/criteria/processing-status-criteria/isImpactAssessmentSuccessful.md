**Evaluation Context**:
- Impact assessment requirements and completion criteria
- Risk analysis thresholds and business rules
- Regulatory impact assessment requirements

### 3. Evaluation Logic
**Decision Algorithm**:
```
IF assessmentStatus = SUCCESS THEN
    IF riskAnalysis.completed = true THEN
        IF positionImpact.analyzed = true THEN
            IF regulatoryImpact.assessed = true THEN
                IF systemImpact.evaluated = true THEN
                    RETURN true (impact assessment successful)
                ELSE
                    RETURN false (system impact incomplete)
            ELSE
                RETURN false (regulatory impact incomplete)
        ELSE
            RETURN false (position impact incomplete)
    ELSE
        RETURN false (risk analysis incomplete)
ELSE
    RETURN false (assessment not successful)
```

**Boolean Logic**:
- Evaluates impact assessment status for successful completion
- Verifies all required risk analysis components have been completed
- Confirms position and portfolio impact analysis has been performed
- Validates regulatory and system impact assessments are complete

**Calculation Methods**:
- Assessment status evaluation based on processing result
- Component completion verification across all impact categories
- Risk threshold evaluation against business requirements

### 4. Success Conditions
**Positive Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Assessment Status Success**: Impact assessment status indicates successful completion
- **Risk Analysis Complete**: All required risk analysis components have been completed
- **Position Impact Analyzed**: Position-level impact analysis has been performed
- **Regulatory Impact Assessed**: Regulatory impact assessment has been completed
- **System Impact Evaluated**: System and operational impact evaluation is complete

**Success Scenarios**:
- **Amendment Impact Assessment**: Comprehensive assessment of trade amendment impacts completed
- **Cancellation Impact Assessment**: Full assessment of trade cancellation impacts completed
- **Portfolio Impact Assessment**: Multi-entity impact assessment completed successfully
- **Regulatory Impact Assessment**: Complete assessment of regulatory reporting impacts

### 5. Failure Conditions
**Negative Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Assessment Status Failed**: Impact assessment status indicates failure or incompletion
- **Risk Analysis Incomplete**: One or more required risk analysis components are incomplete
- **Position Impact Missing**: Position-level impact analysis has not been performed
- **Regulatory Impact Incomplete**: Regulatory impact assessment is incomplete
- **System Impact Missing**: System and operational impact evaluation is incomplete

**Failure Scenarios**:
- **Incomplete Analysis**: Impact assessment fails to complete all required analysis components
- **Data Unavailability**: Required data for impact assessment is not available
- **System Failure**: Technical failure prevents impact assessment completion
- **Threshold Violations**: Impact assessment reveals violations of risk or business thresholds

### 6. Edge Cases
**Boundary Conditions**:
- **Null Assessment Result**: Handle cases where assessment result is null or undefined
- **Partial Assessment**: Handle assessments that are partially complete
- **Timeout Scenarios**: Handle assessments that exceed processing time limits
- **Data Quality Issues**: Handle assessments with incomplete or poor quality input data

**Special Scenarios**:
- **Emergency Assessments**: Handle expedited assessments with reduced requirements
- **Cross-Portfolio Assessments**: Handle assessments spanning multiple portfolios or entities
- **Regulatory Override**: Handle assessments with regulatory override requirements

**Data Absence Handling**:
- Return false when assessment result data is completely unavailable
- Apply conservative evaluation when required assessment fields are missing
- Log warnings when critical assessment information is absent

### 7. Performance Requirements
**SLA Requirements**:
- **Evaluation Time**: 1000 milliseconds (95th percentile)
- **Throughput**: 500 evaluations per second
- **Availability**: 99.95% uptime

**Resource Requirements**:
- **CPU**: Moderate processing for assessment result analysis and component verification
- **Memory**: 256MB for assessment result processing and impact analysis

### 8. Dependencies
**Internal Dependencies**:
- **ImpactAssessmentService**: For accessing impact assessment results
- **RiskAnalysisService**: For risk analysis component verification
- **PositionService**: For position impact analysis results
- **RegulatoryService**: For regulatory impact assessment verification

**External Dependencies**:
