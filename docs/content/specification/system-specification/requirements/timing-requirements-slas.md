Paul Muadib, I have created comprehensive timing requirements and SLA documentation covering all aspects of the DTCC reporting system. This includes regulatory deadlines, performance targets, error recovery times, and business continuity requirements.

Now I'll create the final component - the use case relationship hierarchy - to complete the plan execution.
