# Event-Driven Architecture Patterns and Best Practices

## Overview

This document defines the event-driven architecture patterns, design principles, and best practices for the DTCC Regulatory Reporting System. It establishes standardized approaches for event processing, integration, and system design that ensure scalability, reliability, and regulatory compliance.

## Core Architecture Patterns

### 1. Event Sourcing Pattern

#### Pattern Description
Event sourcing captures all changes to application state as a sequence of events, providing audit trails and enabling temporal queries for regulatory compliance.

#### Implementation in DTCC System
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Business Event] --> B[Event Store]
    B --> C[Event Processor]
    C --> D[State Projection]
    D --> E[Business Entity]
    
    B --> F[Audit Trail]
    B --> G[Regulatory Reports]
    B --> H[Analytics]
```

#### Key Benefits
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every state change captured as immutable event
- **Temporal Queries**: Query system state at any point in time
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Full traceability for regulatory requirements
- **Data Recovery**: Rebuild system state from event history
- **Analytics Support**: Rich event history for business analytics

#### Implementation Guidelines
- **Event Immutability**: Events are never modified after creation
- **Event Ordering**: Maintain strict event ordering within aggregates
- **Snapshot Strategy**: Create periodic snapshots for performance
- **Event Versioning**: Support event schema evolution
- **Retention Policy**: Implement regulatory-compliant retention policies

### 2. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern

#### Pattern Description
CQRS separates read and write operations, optimizing each for their specific use cases and enabling independent scaling.

#### DTCC System Implementation
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[External Command] --> B[Command Handler]
    B --> C[Event Store]
    C --> D[Event Projector]
    D --> E[Read Model]
    
    F[Query Request] --> G[Query Handler]
    G --> E
    
    C --> H[Regulatory Projector]
    H --> I[Regulatory Read Model]
```

#### Benefits for Regulatory Reporting
- **Optimized Queries**: Read models optimized for regulatory reporting
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale read and write sides independently
- **Multiple Projections**: Different views for different regulatory requirements
- **Performance Isolation**: Query performance doesn't impact command processing

### 3. Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions

#### Pattern Description
Saga pattern manages distributed transactions across multiple services using compensating actions for failure recovery.

#### Trade Processing Saga Example
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Saga Coordinator
    participant T as Trade Service
    participant P as Position Service
    participant R as Report Service
    
    C->>T: Process Trade
    T-->>C: Trade Processed
    
    C->>P: Update Position
    P-->>C: Position Updated
    
    C->>R: Generate Report
    R-->>C: Report Generated
    
    Note over C: All steps successful
    
    alt Failure Scenario
        R-->>C: Report Failed
        C->>P: Compensate Position
        C->>T: Compensate Trade
    end
```

#### Saga Implementation Patterns
- **Orchestration**: Central coordinator manages saga execution
- **Choreography**: Services coordinate through events
- **Compensation**: Implement compensating actions for each step
- **Timeout Handling**: Handle timeouts and partial failures
- **Idempotency**: Ensure saga steps are idempotent

### 4. Event Streaming Pattern

#### Pattern Description
Event streaming provides real-time event processing and distribution across the system for immediate response to business events.

#### Streaming Architecture
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Event Producer] --> B[Event Stream]
    B --> C[Stream Processor 1]
    B --> D[Stream Processor 2]
    B --> E[Stream Processor 3]
    
    C --> F[Position Updates]
    D --> G[Risk Monitoring]
    E --> H[Regulatory Alerts]
```

#### Streaming Use Cases
- **Real-time Position Calculation**: Immediate position updates from trade events
- **Risk Monitoring**: Real-time risk threshold monitoring
- **Regulatory Alerting**: Immediate alerts for compliance violations
- **Operational Monitoring**: Real-time system health monitoring

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Event-Driven Integration

#### External System Integration
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[External Trading System] --> B[Event Gateway]
    B --> C[Event Validator]
    C --> D[Event Router]
    D --> E[Trade Processor]
    D --> F[Position Processor]
    D --> G[Report Processor]
    
    E --> H[Internal Event Bus]
    F --> H
    G --> H
```

#### Integration Best Practices
- **Event Gateway**: Single entry point for external events
- **Event Validation**: Validate all external events at boundary
- **Event Transformation**: Transform external events to internal format
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for external system failures
- **Circuit Breaker**: Protect against external system failures

### 2. Publish-Subscribe Pattern

#### Event Distribution
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Event Publisher] --> B[Event Bus]
    B --> C[Subscriber 1: Position Service]
    B --> D[Subscriber 2: Report Service]
    B --> E[Subscriber 3: Audit Service]
    B --> F[Subscriber 4: Monitoring Service]
```

#### Subscription Management
- **Topic-based Subscription**: Subscribe to specific event types
- **Content-based Filtering**: Filter events based on content
- **Durable Subscriptions**: Ensure event delivery even if subscriber offline
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Handle undeliverable events
- **Backpressure Handling**: Manage subscriber overload

### 3. Event Choreography Pattern

#### Decentralized Event Coordination
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as Trade Service
    participant P as Position Service
    participant R as Report Service
    participant A as Audit Service
    
    T->>T: Process Trade
    T->>+: Publish TradeConfirmed
    
    P->>P: Calculate Position
    P->>+: Publish PositionUpdated
    
    R->>R: Generate Report
    R->>+: Publish ReportGenerated
    
    A->>A: Log All Events
```

#### Choreography Benefits
- **Loose Coupling**: Services don't directly depend on each other
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new services without changing existing ones
- **Resilience**: Failure of one service doesn't block others
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify business processes

## Event Processing Patterns

    B -->|Report| E[Report Processor]
    
    C --> F{Trade Type?}
    F -->|New| G[New Trade Handler]
    F -->|Amendment| H[Amendment Handler]
    F -->|Cancellation| I[Cancellation Handler]
```

#### Filtering Strategies
- **Event Type Filtering**: Route based on event type

graph TD
    A[Event Processing] --> B[Critical Events Pool]
    A --> C[Normal Events Pool]
    A --> D[Batch Events Pool]
    
    B --> E[High Priority Resources]
    C --> F[Standard Resources]
    D --> G[Batch Resources]
```

#### Isolation Strategies
- **Thread Pool Isolation**: Separate thread pools for different event types

    E --> F[Return Result]
```

#### Caching Strategies
- **Event Result Caching**: Cache frequently accessed event results
- **Projection Caching**: Cache computed projections
- **Reference Data Caching**: Cache reference data for event processing
- **Query Result Caching**: Cache complex query results

## Monitoring and Observability Patterns

### 1. Event Tracing Pattern

#### Distributed Tracing
```mermaid
