# Event Traceability and Audit Documentation

## Overview

This document defines the complete event traceability framework and audit requirements for the DTCC Regulatory Reporting System. It establishes end-to-end traceability for regulatory audit purposes, compliance monitoring, and operational transparency.

## Audit Traceability Framework

### 1. Regulatory Audit Requirements

#### DTCC GTR Audit Standards
- **Complete Event History**: Full audit trail from trade receipt to regulatory submission
- **Immutable Records**: Tamper-proof event logging with cryptographic integrity
- **Temporal Accuracy**: Precise timestamps for all events with microsecond precision
- **Causal Relationships**: Clear linkage between cause and effect events
- **Data Lineage**: Complete tracking of data transformations and calculations

#### Compliance Audit Scope

    A[External Trade Event] --> B[Message Processing Events]
    B --> C[Validation Events]
    C --> D[Trade Confirmation Events]
    D --> E[Position Calculation Events]
    E --> F[Reporting Events]
    F --> G[Submission Events]
    G --> H[Acknowledgment Events]
    
    I[Amendment Events] --> J[Recalculation Events]
    J --> K[Report Update Events]
    
    L[Error Events] --> M[Recovery Events]
    M --> N[Correction Events]
```

### 2. Event Audit Trail Structure

{
  "auditEventId": "uuid",
  "businessEventId": "uuid",
  "correlationId": "uuid",
  "traceId": "uuid",
  "eventType": "string",
  "eventCategory": "string",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601 with microseconds",
  "source": {

    "component": "string",
    "instance": "string",
    "version": "string"
  },
  "actor": {

### 3. Traceability Correlation Mechanisms

#### Multi-Level Correlation
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Business Process ID] --> B[Workflow Instance ID]
    B --> C[Event Correlation ID]
    C --> D[Data Lineage ID]
    
    E[Trade ID] --> F[Position ID]
    F --> G[Report ID]
    G --> H[Submission ID]
```
