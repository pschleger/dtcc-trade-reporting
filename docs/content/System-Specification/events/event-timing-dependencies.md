# Event Timing Dependencies and Critical Path Analysis

## Overview

This document defines the complete timing dependencies, sequencing requirements, and critical path analysis for all events in the DTCC Regulatory Reporting System. It identifies time-sensitive event sequences that impact regulatory compliance deadlines and operational efficiency.

## Critical Path Analysis

### 1. Trade-to-Report Critical Path

## Timing Dependency Categories

### 1. Hard Dependencies (Blocking)

#### Sequential Processing Dependencies
- **Message Validation → Trade Processing**: Cannot process trade without valid message
- **Trade Confirmation → Position Calculation**: Cannot calculate positions without confirmed trade
- **Position Update → Threshold Evaluation**: Cannot evaluate reporting without current positions
- **Report Generation → Report Submission**: Cannot submit without generated report

#### Resource Dependencies
- **Database Locks**: Position calculations require exclusive access to position entities
- **External System Availability**: LEI validation requires GLEIF system availability
- **Authentication Tokens**: DTCC submission requires valid authentication

### 2. Soft Dependencies (Performance)

#### Optimization Dependencies
- **Batch Processing Windows**: Optimal performance during low-traffic periods
- **Cache Warming**: Better performance with warmed reference data caches
- **Connection Pooling**: Improved throughput with established connections

#### Business Preference Dependencies
- **Business Hours Processing**: Preferred processing during business hours for support
- **Reconciliation Timing**: Preferred after market close for stable data
- **Report Submission**: Preferred early in submission window to allow for corrections

### 3. Regulatory Dependencies (Compliance)

#### Deadline Dependencies
- **T+1 Reporting**: Trade reports must be submitted by T+1 11:59 PM EST
- **Position Reporting**: Daily position reports by 11:59 PM EST
- **Amendment Reporting**: Amendment reports within 24 hours of amendment
- **Error Corrections**: Corrections within 24 hours of error identification

#### Sequencing Dependencies
- **Original Before Amendment**: Original trade must be reported before amendments
- **Cancellation After Confirmation**: Cannot cancel unreported trades
- **Correction After Submission**: Can only correct submitted reports

- **Recovery Time Estimation**: Time required to recover from delays

## Timing Optimization Strategies

### 1. Performance Optimization

#### Processing Acceleration
- **Parallel Processing**: Execute independent events concurrently
- **Batch Optimization**: Group related events for efficient processing
- **Cache Utilization**: Pre-load frequently accessed reference data
- **Connection Pooling**: Maintain persistent connections to external systems

#### Resource Optimization
- **Priority Queuing**: Process critical path events with higher priority
- **Resource Scaling**: Dynamically scale resources based on demand
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute processing across multiple instances

### 2. Business Process Optimization

#### Early Processing
- **Pre-validation**: Validate reference data before trade processing
- **Speculative Processing**: Begin position calculations before trade confirmation
- **Batch Preparation**: Prepare batch processes before cutoff times

#### Deadline Management
- **Early Submission**: Submit reports well before deadlines
- **Deadline Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of deadline proximity
- **Emergency Procedures**: Fast-track processing for deadline-critical events

## Recovery and Contingency

### 1. Timing Recovery Procedures

#### Delay Recovery
- **Fast-track Processing**: Expedited processing for delayed events
- **Resource Reallocation**: Redirect resources to critical path events
- **Parallel Execution**: Execute normally sequential events in parallel
- **Manual Intervention**: Manual processing for critical deadline events

#### Deadline Recovery
- **Emergency Processing**: 24/7 processing for deadline-critical events
- **Regulatory Communication**: Proactive communication with regulators
- **Extension Requests**: Formal requests for deadline extensions
- **Compliance Documentation**: Document all recovery actions for audit

### 2. Contingency Planning

#### System Failure Contingency
- **Backup Systems**: Automatic failover to backup processing systems
- **Manual Processing**: Manual procedures for critical events
- **Data Recovery**: Rapid recovery of processing state and data
- **Communication Plans**: Stakeholder notification of delays and recovery

#### Regulatory Contingency
- **Deadline Extensions**: Procedures for requesting regulatory extensions
- **Alternative Submission**: Backup submission methods and formats
- **Compliance Reporting**: Documentation of delays and mitigation actions
- **Audit Preparation**: Maintain complete records for regulatory review
