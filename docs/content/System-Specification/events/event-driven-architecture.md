# Business Event Processing Requirements

## Overview

The DTCC Regulatory Reporting System processes business events that originate from external sources and trigger regulatory reporting workflows. This document defines the business requirements for how these events drive business processes and ensure regulatory compliance.

## Business Event Processing Principles

### 1. External Event Triggers
All business processing is initiated by events from external sources. These events represent meaningful business occurrences that require regulatory reporting action.

**Business Event Sources:**
- Trading system trade confirmations, amendments, and cancellations
- Regulatory authority acknowledgments and rejections
- Reference data updates from authoritative sources
- Compliance deadline notifications
- Scheduled batch processing triggers

### 2. Business Process Initiation
Each external event initiates specific business processes that must be completed to meet regulatory obligations.

**Process Requirements:**
- Trade confirmation events must initiate trade validation and reporting workflows
- Amendment events must trigger impact assessment and regulatory update processes
- Regulatory authority responses must update compliance status and trigger follow-up actions
- Reference data updates must trigger validation and reconciliation processes

### 3. Business Continuity Requirements
The system must process business events reliably to ensure continuous regulatory compliance.

**Continuity Requirements:**
- Business processes must continue despite temporary system issues
- Critical regulatory deadlines must be met regardless of processing volumes
- Business operations must be traceable for regulatory audit purposes
- Recovery procedures must restore business processing without data loss
