# DTCC Regulatory Reporting System - Master Specification

## Executive Summary

The DTCC Regulatory Reporting System is a comprehensive, event-driven platform built on the Cyoda EDBMS that processes OTC derivatives trades and manages regulatory reporting obligations to the DTCC Global Trade Repository (GTR). This master specification document provides a complete overview and navigation guide to all system components, specifications, and implementation details.

### System Purpose
- Process FpML trade confirmations into structured entities
- Manage regulatory reporting workflows and compliance
- Ensure timely and accurate submission to DTCC GTR
- Maintain audit trails and operational monitoring

### Key Capabilities
- **Entity-Driven Processing**: Transform trades through defined entity lifecycles
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: React to business events with appropriate workflows
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet DTCC GTR reporting requirements and deadlines
- **Scalable Processing**: Handle high-volume trade processing with SLA compliance
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Track system performance and business metrics
