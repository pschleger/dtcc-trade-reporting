# Decision Points and Business Rules

## Overview

This document defines the critical decision points and business rules that govern the DTCC Regulatory Reporting System. These rules determine system behavior at key junctures in the trade processing and regulatory reporting workflows.

## Trade Processing Decision Points

- **BR-003**: Trade date cannot be more than 5 business days in the past
- **BR-004**: Effective date cannot be more than 10 years in the future

**Decision Outcomes**:
- **ACCEPT**: Message passes all validation rules → Continue to business validation
- **REJECT**: Schema or format violations → Return error to sender
- **HOLD**: Missing reference data → Queue for manual review

### DP-002: Business Rule Validation
**Context**: Validation of trade business logic and regulatory requirements

**Decision Criteria**:

- **BR-007**: Notional amount must not exceed counterparty credit limits
- **BR-008**: Trade must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions

**Decision Outcomes**:
- **CONFIRM**: All business rules satisfied → Create confirmed trade entity
- **PENDING**: Minor issues requiring review → Create pending trade entity
- **REJECT**: Major violations → Reject trade and notify sender

### DP-003: Amendment Eligibility
**Context**: Determining whether a trade amendment is permissible

**Decision Criteria**:
- Amendment timing relative to trade date
- Type of amendment requested
- Current trade status
- Regulatory reporting status

**Business Rules**:

- **BR-012**: Material amendments require compliance approval

**Decision Outcomes**:
- **ALLOW**: Amendment meets all criteria → Process amendment
- **REQUIRE_APPROVAL**: Amendment needs manual approval → Route to compliance
- **REJECT**: Amendment violates rules → Reject with explanation

### DP-004: Cancellation Eligibility
**Context**: Determining whether a trade cancellation is permissible

**Decision Criteria**:
- Cancellation timing
- Trade status
- Position impact
- Regulatory reporting status

**Business Rules**:
- **BR-013**: Same-day cancellations allowed until position cutoff
- **BR-014**: Next-day cancellations require operations approval
- **BR-015**: Cannot cancel trades with submitted regulatory reports

- Regulatory deadline proximity
- Report complexity and size
- System capacity
- Business criticality

**Business Rules**:
- **BR-033**: Prioritize reports with nearest deadlines
- **BR-034**: Process trade reports before position reports

- **BR-036**: Batch process routine reports during off-peak hours

**Decision Outcomes**:
- **HIGH_PRIORITY**: Process immediately with dedicated resources
- **NORMAL_PRIORITY**: Process in standard queue
- **LOW_PRIORITY**: Process during off-peak hours

### DP-010: Submission Retry Strategy

## Business Rule Categories and Hierarchy

### Rule Categories
1. **Regulatory Compliance Rules** (BR-001 to BR-015): Non-negotiable regulatory requirements
2. **Business Logic Rules** (BR-016 to BR-030): Core business processing logic
3. **Operational Rules** (BR-031 to BR-040): System operation and performance rules
4. **Exception Handling Rules** (BR-041 to BR-048): Error and recovery management rules

### Rule Priority Hierarchy
1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Highest priority, cannot be overridden
2. **Data Integrity**: Critical for system reliability
3. **Business Logic**: Core business requirements
4. **Operational Efficiency**: Performance and usability considerations

### Rule Enforcement Mechanisms
- **System Enforced**: Automatically enforced by system logic
- **Workflow Enforced**: Enforced through workflow validation
- **Manual Enforced**: Requires manual verification and approval
- **Audit Enforced**: Verified through audit and compliance reviews

## Decision Point Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies
- DP-001 (Message Validation) → DP-002 (Business Validation)
- DP-005 (Position Trigger) → DP-006 (Aggregation Level)
- DP-008 (Threshold Evaluation) → DP-009 (Report Priority)

### Conditional Dependencies
- DP-003 (Amendment) and DP-004 (Cancellation) depend on DP-002 (Business Validation)
- DP-010 (Retry Strategy) depends on DP-009 (Report Priority)
- DP-012 (Recovery Strategy) depends on DP-011 (Error Classification)

### Parallel Evaluations
- DP-005 (Position Trigger) can run parallel with DP-008 (Threshold Evaluation)
- DP-007 (Reconciliation) runs independently of trade processing decisions
- DP-011 (Error Classification) applies across all other decision points

Paul Muadib, I have created documentation for decision points and business rules that govern the DTCC reporting system. This covers all major decision points in the trade processing, position management, and regulatory reporting workflows.

Next, I should create the timing requirements and SLA documentation, and then the use case relationship hierarchy to complete the plan requirements. Would you like me to proceed with those final components?
