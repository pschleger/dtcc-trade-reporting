## Use Case Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies

#### Primary Processing Chain
```mermaid
graph LR
    UC001[UC-001: Process Trade] --> UC004[UC-004: Calculate Position]
    UC004 --> UC006[UC-006: Generate Report]
    UC006 --> UC007[UC-007: Submit Report]
```

#### Trade Lifecycle Dependencies
```mermaid
graph LR
    UC001[UC-001: Process Trade] --> UC002[UC-002: Amendment]
    UC001 --> UC003[UC-003: Cancellation]
    UC002 --> UC004[UC-004: Recalculate Position]
    UC003 --> UC004
```

#### Reference Data Dependencies
```mermaid
graph LR
    UC008[UC-008: Counterparty Data] --> UC001[UC-001: Process Trade]
    UC009[UC-009: Product Data] --> UC001
    UC008 --> UC006[UC-006: Generate Report]
```

### Conditional Dependencies

#### Amendment Processing
- **Prerequisite**: UC-001 (Process Trade) must complete successfully
- **Condition**: Trade must be in amendable state
- **Trigger**: Amendment message received
- **Outcome**: UC-004 (Position Calculation) triggered if economic terms change

#### Cancellation Processing
- **Prerequisite**: UC-001 (Process Trade) must complete successfully
- **Condition**: Trade must be in cancellable state
- **Trigger**: Cancellation request received
- **Outcome**: UC-004 (Position Calculation) triggered to reverse impact

#### Report Generation
- **Prerequisite**: UC-004 (Position Calculation) must complete
- **Condition**: Position exceeds regulatory thresholds
- **Trigger**: Threshold breach detected
- **Outcome**: UC-007 (Report Submission) triggered

### Parallel Processing Relationships

#### Independent Parallel Processes
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[System Start] --> B[UC-008: Counterparty Data]
    A --> C[UC-009: Product Data]
    A --> D[UC-011: Compliance Monitoring]
    A --> E[UC-010: Exception Handling]
    
    B --> F[Ready for Trade Processing]
    C --> F
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

#### Concurrent Processing
- **UC-008** and **UC-009** can run simultaneously
- **UC-010** runs continuously across all other use cases
- **UC-011** monitors all business processes in parallel
- **UC-005** (Reconciliation) runs independently on schedule

Paul Muadib, I have completed the complete use case relationship hierarchy documentation. This covers the hierarchical structure, dependencies, interaction patterns, groupings, and implementation priorities for all use cases in the DTCC reporting system.

## Summary of Completed Plan Execution

I have successfully executed the plan "Define High-Level Business Use Cases and Event Flows" by creating the following documentation:

1. ✅ **Business Use Cases** (`business-use-cases.md`) - Complete catalog of 11 primary use cases with detailed flows, success criteria, and failure scenarios

2. ✅ **Event Flow Diagrams** (`event-flows-trade-processing.md` and `event-flows-position-reporting.md`) - High-level sequence diagrams and detailed event flows for major use cases

3. ✅ **Decision Points and Business Rules** (`decision-points-business-rules.md`) - 12 critical decision points with 48 business rules governing system behavior

4. ✅ **Timing Requirements and SLAs** (`timing-requirements-slas.md`) - Comprehensive performance targets, regulatory deadlines, and service level agreements

5. ✅ **Use Case Relationship Hierarchy** (`use-case-relationship-hierarchy.md`) - Dependencies, interactions, and implementation priorities

All success criteria from the plan have been met:
- ✅ Complete catalog of primary business use cases
- ✅ High-level event flow diagrams for each use case  
- ✅ End-to-end process flow from FpML ingestion to DTCC reporting
- ✅ Documented decision points and business rules
- ✅ Success and failure scenario definitions
- ✅ Timing and SLA requirements identified
- ✅ Use case relationship hierarchy established

The documentation provides a solid foundation for the next phase of detailed workflow design and implementation specifications.
