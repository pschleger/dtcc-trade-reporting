# DTCC Regulatory Reporting System - Workflow State Machine Designs

## Overview

This directory contains the high-level workflow state machine designs for the DTCC Regulatory Reporting System. These designs establish the foundation for detailed Cyoda workflow configurations and ensure comprehensive coverage of all business scenarios.

The actual workflow configurations are located in the `src/main/resources/workflows/` directory of the codebase.
DO NOT PUT ANY workflow configuration artefacts in this directory.

## Workflow State Machines

### Core Processing Workflows
1. **TradeConfirmation Workflow** - Process incoming FpML messages
2. **Trade Workflow** - Manage trade lifecycle from confirmation to maturity
3. **Position Workflow** - Calculate and maintain position data
4. **RegulatoryReport Workflow** - Generate and submit DTCC reports

### Master Data Workflows
5. **Counterparty Workflow** - Manage counterparty master data lifecycle
6. **Product Workflow** - Manage product reference data lifecycle

### Modification Workflows
7. **Amendment Workflow** - Process trade amendments
8. **Cancellation Workflow** - Process trade cancellations

### Quality Assurance Workflows
9. **ReconciliationResult Workflow** - Execute position reconciliation
10. **ProcessingBatch Workflow** - Coordinate batch processing operations

## Key Design Principles

### State Naming Conventions
- All state names start with a letter
- Only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens allowed
- Descriptive names that clearly indicate the entity status

### Transition Types
- **Automated**: System-triggered based on business logic
- **Manual**: User-initiated requiring explicit approval
- **Conditional**: Dependent on external criteria or validation

### Error Handling Patterns
- Consistent error states across all workflows
- Manual review processes for exception handling
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Clear escalation paths for complex issues

## Workflow Dependencies

### Primary Processing Chain
```
TradeConfirmation → Trade → Position → RegulatoryReport
```

### Master Data Dependencies
```
Counterparty (active) ← Trade
Product (active) ← Trade
```

### Modification Dependencies
```
Trade (active) ← Amendment
Trade (active) ← Cancellation
```

## Schema Compliance

All workflow designs are fully compliant with the Cyoda WorkflowConfiguration.json schema version 1.0:

- ✅ Required properties: version, name, initialState, states
- ✅ State naming requirements: start with letter, alphanumeric/underscore/hyphen only
- ✅ Transition structure: required "next" property
- ✅ Manual transition flags: properly marked
- ✅ Terminal states: empty transitions arrays

## Business Use Case Coverage

All 11 business use cases identified in Task 2 are fully supported:

### Trade Processing (UC-001 to UC-003)
- New trade confirmation processing
- Trade amendment handling
- Trade cancellation processing

### Position Management (UC-004 to UC-005)
- Real-time position calculation
- Position data reconciliation

### Regulatory Reporting (UC-006 to UC-007)
- DTCC GTR report generation
- Report submission and tracking

### Reference Data Management (UC-008 to UC-009)
- Counterparty data maintenance
- Product reference data management

### Exception Handling (UC-010 to UC-011)
- Processing failure management
- Regulatory compliance monitoring

## Implementation Guidelines

### Cyoda Configuration
1. Use the state machine definitions in `workflow-state-machines.md` as the basis for Cyoda WorkflowConfiguration.json files
2. Implement function-type conditions for business logic validation
3. Configure processors for automated state transitions
4. Set up manual transition triggers for user-initiated actions

### Error Handling
1. Implement consistent error recovery patterns across all workflows
2. Configure appropriate retry mechanisms for transient failures
3. Set up escalation procedures for manual review states
4. Maintain complete audit trails for all state transitions

### Performance Considerations
1. Design for automated processing to meet SLA requirements
2. Minimize manual intervention points to critical decision points only
3. Implement efficient state transition logic
4. Consider batch processing for high-volume operations

## Validation and Testing

### State Machine Validation
- Verify all states are reachable from initial state
- Confirm all terminal states are properly defined
- Validate state naming compliance with schema
- Test all transition paths including error scenarios

### Business Logic Validation
- Confirm all business use cases are supported
- Validate timing requirements can be met
- Test cross-workflow dependencies and coordination
- Verify manual intervention points are appropriate

### Integration Testing
- Test workflow coordination and event handling
- Validate master data dependencies
- Confirm error propagation and recovery
- Test batch processing coordination

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Extensions
1. **Workflow Versioning** - Support for workflow configuration versioning
2. **Dynamic State Configuration** - Runtime state machine modifications
3. **Advanced Analytics** - Workflow performance monitoring and optimization
4. **Multi-Jurisdiction Support** - Extended workflows for different regulatory regimes

### Scalability Considerations
1. **Parallel Processing** - Enhanced support for concurrent workflow execution
2. **Load Balancing** - Distribution of workflow processing across multiple instances
3. **State Persistence** - Optimized state storage and retrieval mechanisms
4. **Event Streaming** - Integration with event streaming platforms for real-time processing

Paul Muadib, I have successfully completed the high-level workflow state machine designs for the DTCC reporting system. The deliverables include:

1. **Complete state machine definitions** for all 10 workflow-managed entities
2. **State transition diagrams** using Mermaid notation for visualization
3. **Cross-workflow dependencies** documentation showing coordination points
4. **Workflow interaction diagram** showing overall system coordination
5. **Schema compliance validation** confirming adherence to Cyoda requirements
6. **Use case coverage validation** ensuring all business scenarios are supported

All designs comply with the Cyoda WorkflowConfiguration.json schema and support the complete set of business use cases identified in Task 2.
