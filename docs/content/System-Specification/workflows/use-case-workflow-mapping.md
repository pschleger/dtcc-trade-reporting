## Use Case Dependency Validation

### Sequential Dependencies ✅
- UC-001 → UC-004 → UC-006 → UC-007: Fully supported by workflow chain
- UC-008 → UC-001: Counterparty must be `active` before Trade processing
- UC-009 → UC-001: Product must be `active` before Trade processing

### Parallel Processing ✅
- UC-004 concurrent with UC-008/UC-009: Position calculation independent of reference data updates
- UC-010 continuous across all use cases: Error handling built into all workflows
- UC-011 continuous across all use cases: Compliance monitoring integrated

### Conditional Flows ✅
- UC-002/UC-003 conditional on UC-001: Amendment/Cancellation require active Trade
- UC-005 triggered by schedule: ReconciliationResult initiated by ProcessingBatch
- UC-007 conditional on UC-006: Report submission requires successful generation
