## Integration Testing Scenarios

### Test Flow Diagrams

The following scenarios should be tested for each external interface:

1. **Happy Path Testing**: Normal operation flow
2. **Error Condition Testing**: Various failure scenarios
3. **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing
4. **Security Testing**: Authentication and authorization validation
5. **Disaster Recovery Testing**: Failover and recovery procedures

### Monitoring and Validation

Each interface requires continuous monitoring with the following metrics:
- **Connectivity**: Network connectivity and protocol compliance
- **Performance**: Response times and throughput
- **Reliability**: Error rates and availability
- **Security**: Authentication success rates and security violations

## Conclusion

These interaction diagrams provide a complete view of how the DTCC Regulatory Reporting System integrates with external systems. They serve as a reference for:

- **Development Teams**: Understanding integration requirements
- **Operations Teams**: Monitoring and troubleshooting
- **Security Teams**: Validating security controls
- **Business Teams**: Understanding data flow and dependencies

Regular updates to these diagrams are required as the system evolves and new integrations are added.
