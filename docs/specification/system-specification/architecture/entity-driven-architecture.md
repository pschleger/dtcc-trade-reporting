# Entity-Driven Architecture for DTCC Regulatory Reporting

## Executive Summary

The DTCC Regulatory Reporting System is built on the Cyoda EDBMS platform, which implements a pure entity-driven architecture. In this architecture, there are **no special engines that process events**. Instead, all business logic is encapsulated within entity workflows that are executed by the Cyoda platform based on defined state machines.

## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Entity-Centric Design
- All business data is modeled as entities with defined lifecycles
- Each entity encapsulates both data and behavior through workflows
- Entities progress through well-defined states via state machines
- Business logic resides within entity workflows, not external processors

### 2. No Processing Engines
- The system contains **no separate processing engines**
- No ingestion engines, calculation engines, or reporting engines
- All processing occurs within entity workflows
- The Cyoda platform orchestrates entity workflows based on events and state transitions

### 3. Workflow-Driven Processing
- Entity behavior is defined by finite state machines
- State transitions are guarded by criteria and trigger processors
- Workflows can be synchronous or asynchronous
- Each workflow maintains complete audit trails

### 4. Event-Driven State Transitions
- External events trigger entity workflow state transitions
- Entity state changes can trigger other entity workflows
- All events are processed through the entity workflow system
- No external event processing systems required

## Entity Workflow Architecture

### Core Entity Types

#### Master Data Entities
- **Counterparty**: Legal entity management with validation workflows
- **Product**: Financial instrument definitions with lifecycle workflows
- **ReferenceData**: Market data with update and validation workflows
- **LegalEntity**: Organizational data with compliance workflows

#### Transactional Entities
- **TradeConfirmation**: FpML processing with validation and conversion workflows
- **Trade**: Core trade data with lifecycle and amendment workflows
- **Position**: Aggregated positions with calculation and reconciliation workflows
- **Amendment**: Trade modifications with approval and application workflows
- **Cancellation**: Trade terminations with validation and processing workflows

#### Regulatory Entities
- **RegulatoryReport**: DTCC reports with generation and submission workflows
- **ReportingObligation**: Compliance tracking with monitoring workflows
- **SubmissionStatus**: Delivery tracking with retry and acknowledgment workflows
- **AuditTrail**: Compliance history with archival workflows

#### Control Entities
- **ProcessingBatch**: Batch coordination with monitoring workflows
- **ValidationResult**: Quality assessment with review workflows
- **ReconciliationResult**: Position verification with exception handling workflows

### Entity Workflow Interactions

#### Primary Processing Flows

1. **Trade Confirmation Processing**
   ```
   FpML Message → TradeConfirmation Entity Workflow → Trade Entity Workflow
   ```

2. **Position Management**
   ```
   Trade Entity State Change → Position Entity Workflow → Calculation & Reconciliation
   ```

3. **Regulatory Reporting**
   ```
   Position Entity Ready → RegulatoryReport Entity Workflow → Submission & Tracking
   ```

#### Cross-Entity Dependencies

- **TradeConfirmation** entities create **Trade** entities upon successful validation
- **Trade** entity state changes trigger **Position** entity recalculation workflows
- **Position** entities in ready state trigger **RegulatoryReport** entity creation
- **Amendment** and **Cancellation** entities modify **Trade** entities through workflows
- **Master data** entities provide reference data to transactional entity workflows

## Platform Integration

### Cyoda EDBMS Platform Services

- **Entity Database**: Stores all entities with complete version history
- **Workflow Engine**: Executes entity workflows based on state machines
- **State Machine Manager**: Manages entity state transitions and criteria evaluation
- **Event System**: Coordinates entity workflow interactions
- **API Layer**: Provides entity access and management interfaces

### External System Integration

- **Trading Systems**: Send FpML messages that create TradeConfirmation entities
- **DTCC GTR**: Receives reports from RegulatoryReport entity submission workflows
- **Reference Data Providers**: Update ReferenceData entities through integration workflows
- **Risk Management Systems**: Query Position entities through API interfaces

## Scalability and Performance

### Distributed Entity Processing

- Entity workflows execute independently across platform nodes
- No shared state between entity workflows enables horizontal scaling
- Platform automatically distributes entity processing load
- Entity caching optimizes frequently accessed entity retrieval

### Workflow Optimization

- Asynchronous workflows prevent blocking operations
- Batch entities coordinate bulk processing efficiently
- State machine optimization reduces unnecessary transitions
- Platform-level resource management optimizes workflow execution

## Operational Considerations

### Monitoring and Alerting

- Entity state monitoring tracks workflow progress
- Stuck entity detection identifies processing issues
- SLA monitoring alerts on regulatory deadline violations
- Platform health monitoring tracks overall system performance

### Error Handling and Recovery

- Entity workflows transition to error states for failure handling
- Retry workflows automatically handle transient errors
- Manual review states route complex errors to operations teams
- Platform recovery mechanisms restore entity processing after failures

## Benefits of Entity-Driven Architecture

### Business Alignment
- Entity models directly reflect business concepts
- Workflows capture business processes naturally
- State machines provide clear business logic visualization
- Audit trails maintain complete business history

### Technical Advantages
- No complex integration between separate processing systems
- Platform handles all workflow orchestration and coordination
- Simplified deployment and maintenance
- Built-in scalability and fault tolerance

### Regulatory Compliance
- Complete audit trails for all entity changes
- Immutable entity history for regulatory requirements
- Clear data lineage through entity relationships
- Automated compliance monitoring through entity workflows

## Implementation Guidelines

### Entity Design Principles
- Model entities to reflect real business objects
- Design workflows to capture complete business processes
- Use state machines to enforce business rules
- Maintain clear entity relationships and dependencies

### Workflow Development
- Implement business logic within entity workflows
- Use criteria to guard state transitions appropriately
- Design processors for specific workflow steps
- Ensure proper error handling and recovery paths

### Platform Utilization
- Leverage platform services for entity management
- Use platform APIs for external system integration
- Rely on platform scaling and performance optimization
- Utilize platform monitoring and alerting capabilities

## Conclusion

The entity-driven architecture of the DTCC Regulatory Reporting System eliminates the complexity of traditional layered architectures by encapsulating all business logic within entity workflows. This approach provides better business alignment, simplified technical implementation, and robust regulatory compliance capabilities while leveraging the full power of the Cyoda EDBMS platform.
