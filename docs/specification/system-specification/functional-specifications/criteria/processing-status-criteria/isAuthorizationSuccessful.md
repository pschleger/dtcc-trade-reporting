# Component Specification: isAuthorizationSuccessful

### 1. Component Overview
**Component Name**: isAuthorizationSuccessful
**Component Type**: CyodaCriterion
**Business Domain**: Processing Status Criteria
**Purpose**: Evaluates whether authorization processes have completed successfully with proper approvals and compliance checks
**Workflow Context**: Used across workflows requiring authorization to determine if authorization operations have been successfully completed

### 2. Input Parameters
**Entity Type**: AuthorizationResult
**Required Fields**:
- `authorizationId`: string - Unique identifier for the authorization process
- `authorizationStatus`: string - Status of authorization (AUTHORIZED, DENIED, PENDING, EXPIRED)
- `authorizationTimestamp`: string (ISO-8601) - When authorization was completed
- `requestType`: string - Type of request requiring authorization (AMENDMENT, CANCELLATION, TRADE)
- `authorizerDetails`: object - Information about the authorizing party

**Optional Fields**:
- `approvalLevel`: string - Level of approval obtained (STANDARD, SENIOR, EXECUTIVE)
- `complianceChecks`: object - Results of compliance verification checks
- `riskAssessment`: object - Risk assessment results for authorization
- `conditions`: array - Any conditions attached to the authorization

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `attachEntity`: boolean - Whether to attach entity to evaluation context
- `calculationNodesTags`: string - Tags for distributed evaluation nodes
- `responseTimeoutMs`: integer - Maximum evaluation time in milliseconds (default: 1500)
- `context`: string - Evaluation context identifier

**Evaluation Context**:
- Authorization requirements and approval criteria
- Compliance verification requirements
- Risk assessment thresholds and business rules

### 3. Evaluation Logic
**Decision Algorithm**:
```
IF authorizationStatus = AUTHORIZED THEN
    IF complianceChecks.allPassed = true THEN
        IF riskAssessment.approved = true THEN
            IF authorizerDetails.authorized = true THEN
                RETURN true (authorization successful)
            ELSE
                RETURN false (unauthorized authorizer)
        ELSE
            RETURN false (risk assessment failed)
    ELSE
        RETURN false (compliance checks failed)
ELSE
    RETURN false (authorization not granted)
```

**Boolean Logic**:
- Evaluates authorization status for successful completion
- Verifies all required compliance checks have passed
- Confirms risk assessment has been approved
- Validates authorizer has proper authority for the request type

**Calculation Methods**:
- Authorization status evaluation based on approval result
- Compliance check aggregation for overall success determination
- Risk assessment verification against business thresholds

### 4. Success Conditions
**Positive Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Authorization Granted**: Authorization status indicates successful approval
- **Compliance Verified**: All required compliance checks have passed
- **Risk Approved**: Risk assessment has been completed and approved
- **Authorized Approver**: Authorizer has proper authority for the request type
- **Valid Authorization**: Authorization is within validity period and not expired

**Success Scenarios**:
- **Standard Authorization**: Regular authorization completed with standard approval process
- **Senior Authorization**: High-value authorization completed with senior management approval
- **Emergency Authorization**: Expedited authorization completed with emergency procedures
- **Automated Authorization**: System-based authorization completed with automated approval

### 5. Failure Conditions
**Negative Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Authorization Denied**: Authorization status indicates denial or rejection
- **Compliance Failures**: One or more required compliance checks have failed
- **Risk Rejection**: Risk assessment has been rejected or failed
- **Unauthorized Approver**: Authorizer lacks proper authority for the request type
- **Expired Authorization**: Authorization has expired or is no longer valid

**Failure Scenarios**:
- **Approval Denial**: Authorization request is explicitly denied by approver
- **Compliance Violation**: Authorization fails regulatory or policy compliance checks
- **Risk Threshold Exceeded**: Authorization exceeds acceptable risk thresholds
- **Insufficient Authority**: Approver lacks sufficient authority for the authorization level required

### 6. Edge Cases
**Boundary Conditions**:
- **Null Authorization Result**: Handle cases where authorization result is null or undefined
- **Pending Authorization**: Handle authorizations that are still in progress
- **Conditional Authorization**: Handle authorizations granted with specific conditions
- **Partial Authorization**: Handle scenarios where some authorization aspects succeed but others fail

**Special Scenarios**:
- **Emergency Override**: Handle emergency authorizations with different approval requirements
- **Delegated Authority**: Handle authorizations made under delegated authority arrangements
- **Time-Limited Authorization**: Handle authorizations with specific time constraints

**Data Absence Handling**:
- Return false when authorization result data is completely unavailable
- Apply conservative evaluation when required authorization fields are missing
- Log warnings when critical authorization information is absent

### 7. Performance Requirements
**SLA Requirements**:
- **Evaluation Time**: 300 milliseconds (95th percentile)
- **Throughput**: 2000 evaluations per second
- **Availability**: 99.95% uptime

**Resource Requirements**:
- **CPU**: Minimal processing for status evaluation and compliance verification
- **Memory**: 64MB for authorization result processing and validation

### 8. Dependencies
**Internal Dependencies**:
- **AuthorizationService**: For accessing authorization results and status
- **ComplianceService**: For compliance check verification
- **RiskAssessmentService**: For risk assessment result verification
- **UserManagementService**: For authorizer authority verification

**External Dependencies**:
- **Authorization Database**: For authorization result persistence (SLA: 99.9% availability)
- **Compliance System**: For compliance verification (SLA: 99.95% availability)
- **Risk Management System**: For risk assessment data (SLA: 99.9% availability)

**Data Dependencies**:
- Authorization configuration and approval requirements
- Compliance verification criteria and regulatory rules
- Risk assessment thresholds and business policies

### 9. Configuration
**Configurable Thresholds**:
- `requiredComplianceChecks`: array - List of required compliance verifications - Default: ["regulatory", "policy", "risk"]
- `riskAssessmentRequired`: boolean - Whether risk assessment is required - Default: true
- `authorizerValidationEnabled`: boolean - Whether to validate authorizer authority - Default: true

**Evaluation Parameters**:
- `allowConditionalAuthorization`: boolean - Whether to accept conditional authorizations - Default: true
- `authorizationExpiryToleranceMs`: integer - Tolerance for authorization expiry - Default: 300000
- `emergencyOverrideEnabled`: boolean - Whether emergency override is allowed - Default: false

**Environment-Specific Settings**:
- **Development**: Relaxed authorization requirements for testing
- **Production**: Strict authorization and compliance requirements

### 10. Error Handling
**Evaluation Errors**:
- **DATA_UNAVAILABLE**: Authorization result data not accessible
- **EVALUATION_TIMEOUT**: Evaluation exceeded timeout period
- **CONFIGURATION_ERROR**: Invalid evaluation configuration parameters
- **SYSTEM_ERROR**: Technical evaluation failure

**Error Recovery**:
- Return false (authorization not successful) when authorization data is unavailable
- Apply default configuration when evaluation parameters are invalid
- Log evaluation errors for monitoring and troubleshooting

**Error Propagation**:
- Evaluation errors are logged with full context and authorization details
- Critical evaluation failures trigger monitoring alerts
- Failed evaluations are tracked for system reliability assessment
