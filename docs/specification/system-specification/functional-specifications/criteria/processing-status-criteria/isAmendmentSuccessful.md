# Component Specification: isAmendmentSuccessful

### 1. Component Overview
**Component Name**: isAmendmentSuccessful
**Component Type**: CyodaCriterion
**Business Domain**: Processing Status Criteria
**Purpose**: Evaluates whether trade amendment processing has completed successfully with all required validations and updates
**Workflow Context**: Used in amendment processing workflows to determine if amendment operations have been successfully completed

### 2. Input Parameters
**Entity Type**: AmendmentProcessingResult
**Required Fields**:
- `amendmentId`: string - Unique identifier for the amendment process
- `amendmentStatus`: string - Status of amendment processing (SUCCESS, FAILED, PENDING, PARTIAL)
- `processingTimestamp`: string (ISO-8601) - When amendment processing was completed
- `originalTradeId`: string - Identifier of the original trade being amended
- `amendedTradeId`: string - Identifier of the amended trade entity

**Optional Fields**:
- `validationResults`: object - Results of amendment validation checks
- `impactAssessment`: object - Assessment of amendment impact on positions and risk
- `approvalStatus`: string - Status of amendment approval process
- `errorDetails`: array - Details of any errors encountered during processing

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `attachEntity`: boolean - Whether to attach entity to evaluation context
- `calculationNodesTags`: string - Tags for distributed evaluation nodes
- `responseTimeoutMs`: integer - Maximum evaluation time in milliseconds (default: 2000)
- `context`: string - Evaluation context identifier

**Evaluation Context**:
- Amendment processing requirements and validation criteria
- Business rules for successful amendment completion
- Integration requirements with downstream systems

### 3. Evaluation Logic
**Decision Algorithm**:
```
IF amendmentStatus = SUCCESS THEN
    IF validationResults.allPassed = true THEN
        IF impactAssessment.completed = true THEN
            IF approvalStatus = APPROVED OR approvalStatus = AUTO_APPROVED THEN
                RETURN true (amendment successful)
            ELSE
                RETURN false (approval pending or denied)
        ELSE
            RETURN false (impact assessment incomplete)
    ELSE
        RETURN false (validation failures)
ELSE
    RETURN false (amendment not successful)
```

**Boolean Logic**:
- Evaluates amendment processing status for successful completion
- Verifies all required validation checks have passed
- Confirms impact assessment has been completed successfully
- Validates approval status meets requirements for amendment completion

**Calculation Methods**:
- Amendment status evaluation based on processing result
- Validation result aggregation for overall success determination
- Approval status verification against business requirements

### 4. Success Conditions
**Positive Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Amendment Status Success**: Amendment processing status indicates successful completion
- **All Validations Passed**: All required validation checks have passed successfully
- **Impact Assessment Complete**: Amendment impact assessment has been completed
- **Approval Obtained**: Amendment has received required approval (manual or automatic)
- **No Critical Errors**: No critical errors encountered during amendment processing

**Success Scenarios**:
- **Standard Amendment**: Trade amendment processed successfully with all validations passed
- **Auto-Approved Amendment**: Amendment meets criteria for automatic approval and processing
- **Complex Amendment**: Multi-step amendment process completed successfully with manual approval
- **Corrective Amendment**: Amendment to correct previous errors processed successfully

### 5. Failure Conditions
**Negative Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Amendment Status Failed**: Amendment processing status indicates failure
- **Validation Failures**: One or more required validation checks have failed
- **Impact Assessment Incomplete**: Amendment impact assessment has not been completed
- **Approval Denied**: Amendment approval has been denied or is still pending
- **Critical Errors Present**: Critical errors encountered during amendment processing

**Failure Scenarios**:
- **Validation Rejection**: Amendment fails business rule or data validation checks
- **Approval Denial**: Amendment is rejected during approval process
- **System Failure**: Technical system failure prevents amendment completion
- **Incomplete Processing**: Amendment processing is incomplete or partially failed

### 6. Edge Cases
**Boundary Conditions**:
- **Null Amendment Result**: Handle cases where amendment result is null or undefined
- **Pending Status**: Handle amendments that are still in progress
- **Partial Success**: Handle scenarios where some amendment steps succeed but others fail
- **Timeout Scenarios**: Handle amendments that exceed processing time limits

**Special Scenarios**:
- **Emergency Amendments**: Handle expedited amendments with different approval requirements
- **Bulk Amendments**: Handle batch amendment processing with aggregate success criteria
- **Rollback Scenarios**: Handle amendments that require rollback due to downstream failures

**Data Absence Handling**:
- Return false when amendment result data is completely unavailable
- Apply conservative evaluation when required amendment fields are missing
- Log warnings when critical amendment information is absent

### 7. Performance Requirements
**SLA Requirements**:
- **Evaluation Time**: 500 milliseconds (95th percentile)
- **Throughput**: 1000 evaluations per second
- **Availability**: 99.95% uptime

**Resource Requirements**:
- **CPU**: Low processing for status evaluation and validation result analysis
- **Memory**: 128MB for amendment result processing and validation

### 8. Dependencies
**Internal Dependencies**:
- **AmendmentProcessingService**: For accessing amendment processing results
- **ValidationService**: For amendment validation result verification
- **ApprovalService**: For amendment approval status information
- **ImpactAssessmentService**: For amendment impact assessment results

**External Dependencies**:
- **Amendment Database**: For amendment processing result persistence (SLA: 99.9% availability)
- **Trade Management System**: For trade entity access and updates (SLA: 99.95% availability)

**Data Dependencies**:
- Amendment processing configuration and business rules
- Validation criteria and approval requirements
- Impact assessment thresholds and criteria

### 9. Configuration
**Configurable Thresholds**:
- `requiredValidations`: array - List of required validation checks - Default: ["business_rules", "data_quality", "regulatory"]
- `approvalRequired`: boolean - Whether manual approval is required - Default: true
- `impactAssessmentRequired`: boolean - Whether impact assessment is required - Default: true

**Evaluation Parameters**:
- `allowPartialSuccess`: boolean - Whether to allow partial success scenarios - Default: false
- `timeoutToleranceMs`: integer - Tolerance for processing timeout - Default: 5000
- `criticalErrorTolerance`: boolean - Whether to tolerate critical errors - Default: false

**Environment-Specific Settings**:
- **Development**: Relaxed validation requirements for testing
- **Production**: Strict validation and approval requirements

### 10. Error Handling
**Evaluation Errors**:
- **DATA_UNAVAILABLE**: Amendment result data not accessible
- **EVALUATION_TIMEOUT**: Evaluation exceeded timeout period
- **CONFIGURATION_ERROR**: Invalid evaluation configuration parameters
- **SYSTEM_ERROR**: Technical evaluation failure

**Error Recovery**:
- Return false (amendment not successful) when amendment data is unavailable
- Apply default configuration when evaluation parameters are invalid
- Log evaluation errors for monitoring and troubleshooting

**Error Propagation**:
- Evaluation errors are logged with full context and amendment details
- Critical evaluation failures trigger monitoring alerts
- Failed evaluations are tracked for system reliability assessment
