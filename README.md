# DTCC Regulatory Reporting System

A proof-of-concept project exploring how far one can build a DTCC regulatory trade reporting system entirely with AI ‚Äî from requirements and specifications to implementation and testing. The human acts primarily as an orchestrator, intervening only as a last resort.

---

## üöÄ System Overview

- **Entity-Driven Processing**: Transform trades through defined entity lifecycles using Cyoda workflows
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: React to business events with appropriate state machine transitions
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet DTCC GTR reporting requirements and deadlines
- **Scalable Processing**: Handle high-volume trade processing with SLA compliance
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Track system performance and business metrics with full audit trails

### Key Capabilities

- Process **FpML trade confirmations** into structured Trade entities
- Maintain **position calculations** and reconciliation workflows
- Generate and submit **regulatory reports** to DTCC GTR
- Manage **master data** (counterparties, products, legal entities)
- Handle **trade lifecycle events** (amendments, cancellations, maturities)
- Provide **exception handling** and manual intervention workflows

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

> ‚òï **Java 21 Required**  
> Make sure Java 21 is installed and set as the active version.

### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone <your-repository-URL>
cd dtcc-regulatory-reporting
```

### 2. üß∞ Run Workflow Import Tool

Import the DTCC regulatory reporting workflows into Cyoda:

#### Option 1: Run via Gradle (recommended for local development)
```bash
./gradlew runApp -PmainClass=com.java_template.common.tool.WorkflowImportTool
```

#### Option 2: Build and Run JAR (recommended for CI or scripting)
```bash
./gradlew bootJarWorkflowImport
java -jar build/libs/dtcc-regulatory-reporting-1.0-SNAPSHOT-workflow-import.jar
```

### 3. ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Application

#### Option 1: Run via Gradle
```bash
./gradlew runApp
```

#### Option 2: Run Manually After Build
```bash
./gradlew build
java -jar build/libs/dtcc-regulatory-reporting-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Business Entities

#### 1. Master Data Entities
- **Counterparty**: Legal entity information with KYC/AML workflows
- **Product**: OTC derivatives product definitions with validation workflows  
- **LegalEntity**: Organizational structure with LEI validation workflows

#### 2. Trade Processing Entities
- **TradeConfirmation**: FpML message processing with validation workflows
- **Trade**: Core trade representation with lifecycle management workflows
- **Position**: Aggregated position calculations with reconciliation workflows

#### 3. Regulatory Entities
- **RegulatoryReport**: DTCC GTR reports with generation and submission workflows
- **ReportingObligation**: Compliance tracking with monitoring workflows
- **SubmissionStatus**: Report delivery tracking with retry workflows
- **AuditTrail**: Compliance history with archival workflows

### Workflow-Driven Processing

All business logic is implemented through **Cyoda workflows** using finite state machines:

- **Processors**: Implement `CyodaProcessor` interface for business logic execution
- **Criteria**: Implement `CyodaCriterion` interface for decision-making logic
- **State Machines**: Define entity lifecycles with transitions and validations
- **Event Processing**: React to business events through workflow orchestration

## üß© Project Structure

### `application/entity/`
Domain entities implementing `CyodaEntity`:

- `counterparty/` ‚Äì Counterparty entity and workflow
- `trade/` ‚Äì Trade entity and lifecycle workflow  
- `position/` ‚Äì Position entity and calculation workflow
- `regulatory_report/` ‚Äì Regulatory report entity and submission workflow
- `trade_confirmation/` ‚Äì FpML confirmation processing workflow

### `application/processor/`
Workflow processors implementing `CyodaProcessor`:

- `trade_confirmation/` ‚Äì FpML validation and conversion processors
- `trade_management/` ‚Äì Trade lifecycle processors
- `position_management/` ‚Äì Position calculation processors
- `regulatory_reporting/` ‚Äì Report generation and submission processors
- `master_data/` ‚Äì Reference data management processors

### `application/criterion/`
Workflow criteria implementing `CyodaCriterion`:

- `validation/` ‚Äì Data validation criteria

## üìã Business Use Cases

### Primary Workflows

1. **Trade Confirmation Processing**: Validate and convert FpML messages to Trade entities
2. **Trade Lifecycle Management**: Handle amendments, cancellations, and maturities
3. **Position Calculation**: Aggregate trades into positions with real-time updates
4. **Regulatory Report Generation**: Create DTCC GTR compliant reports
5. **Report Submission**: Submit reports to DTCC GTR with acknowledgment tracking
6. **Master Data Management**: Maintain counterparty and product reference data
7. **Exception Handling**: Process validation failures and business rule violations

### Regulatory Compliance

- **DTCC GTR Requirements**: Full compliance with reporting obligations
- **FpML Standards**: Support for FpML 5.x trade confirmation formats
- **Audit Trails**: Immutable audit logs for all entity state changes
- **SLA Compliance**: Meet regulatory timing requirements for report submission

---

## üîÑ Workflow Configuration

Entity workflows are defined in JSON configuration files:

```
application/entity/$entity_name/Workflow.json
```

Each workflow implements a **finite state machine** with:
- **States**: Business states with defined transitions
- **Processors**: Business logic execution components  
- **Criteria**: Decision-making logic for state transitions
- **Manual Transitions**: Support for manual intervention workflows

Example workflow structure for Trade entity:
- `received` ‚Üí `validated` ‚Üí `enriched` ‚Üí `position_updated` ‚Üí `reported`
