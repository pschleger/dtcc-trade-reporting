    "currentApprovalLevel": "SENIOR_MANAGEMENT"
  }
}
```

**Side Effects**:
- Updates cancellation entity with authorization status
- Creates authorization audit trail
- Triggers approval workflow if additional approvals needed
- Publishes authorization events for downstream systems

## 4. Business Logic
**Processing Steps**:
1. Validate cancellation authorization request
2. Retrieve impact assessment and approval requirements
3. Verify user authorization level for cancellation type
4. Check business rule compliance for cancellation
5. Validate counterparty consent requirements
6. Assess regulatory approval requirements
7. Execute approval workflow based on impact level
8. Validate all required approvals obtained
9. Generate authorization decision and conditions
10. Update cancellation status and trigger next steps

**Business Rules**:
- **Authorization Hierarchy**: Different cancellation impacts require different approval levels
- **Counterparty Consent**: Certain cancellations require counterparty agreement
- **Regulatory Approval**: High-impact cancellations may require regulatory notification
- **Time Constraints**: Cancellations must be authorized within specified timeframes
- **Business Justification**: All cancellations must have valid business justification

**Algorithms**:
- Authorization level determination based on impact assessment
- Approval workflow routing based on cancellation characteristics
- Business rule evaluation using rule engine
- Regulatory requirement assessment based on jurisdiction

## 5. Validation Rules
**Pre-processing Validations**:
- **Authorization Request Validity**: Request must be properly formatted and complete
- **Impact Assessment Availability**: Completed impact assessment must be available
- **User Authorization**: Requesting user must have cancellation request privileges
- **Trade Cancellability**: Trade must be in a state that allows cancellation

**Post-processing Validations**:
- **Approval Completeness**: All required approvals must be obtained
- **Business Rule Compliance**: Authorization must comply with all business rules
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Authorization must meet regulatory requirements
- **Condition Validation**: All authorization conditions must be properly set

**Data Quality Checks**:
- **Authorization Data Integrity**: All authorization data must be complete and accurate
- **Approval Chain Validation**: Approval chain must be valid and complete
- **Timestamp Consistency**: All timestamps must be consistent and valid

## 6. Error Handling
**Error Categories**:
- **VALIDATION_ERROR**: Authorization request validation failures
- **AUTHORIZATION_DENIED**: Authorization denied due to business rules
- **APPROVAL_INCOMPLETE**: Required approvals not obtained
- **SYSTEM_ERROR**: Technical system failures
- **TIMEOUT_ERROR**: Authorization timeout exceeded

**Error Recovery**:
- Detailed denial reasons for resubmission
- Partial authorization for correctable issues
- Escalation procedures for emergency cancellations

**Error Propagation**:
- Comprehensive error details provided to requesting system
- Cancellation status updated with authorization failure information
- Error notifications sent to relevant stakeholders
