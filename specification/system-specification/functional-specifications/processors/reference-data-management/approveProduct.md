- Generates notifications to relevant departments and stakeholders

### 4. Business Logic
**Processing Steps**:
1. Validate product approval request completeness and format
2. Verify product committee authority and member availability
3. Perform comprehensive risk assessment and regulatory compliance check
4. Execute approval workflow with committee review and voting
5. Apply approval conditions and restrictions if applicable
6. Update product master data with approval status and conditions
7. Generate approval documentation and audit trail
8. Trigger downstream product setup and configuration workflows

**Business Rules**:
- **Committee Authority**: Product committee must have authority for product type and risk level
- **Risk Limits**: Product risk profile must be within approved risk appetite
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Product must comply with all applicable regulations
- **Documentation Requirements**: Complete documentation must be provided for approval
- **Approval Conditions**: Approved products may have conditions and restrictions

**Algorithms**:
- Risk scoring algorithm based on product characteristics and market conditions
- Regulatory compliance assessment using rule-based evaluation
- Committee voting and consensus determination logic

### 5. Validation Rules
**Pre-processing Validations**:
- **Product Uniqueness**: Product must not already exist in approved status
- **Committee Composition**: Approval committee must have required members and quorum
- **Documentation Completeness**: All required documentation must be provided
- **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive risk assessment must be completed

**Post-processing Validations**:
- **Approval Decision**: Valid approval decision must be recorded
- **Status Update**: Product status must be successfully updated
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail must be created
- **Notification Delivery**: All required notifications must be sent

**Data Quality Checks**:
- Product specification completeness and consistency
- Risk assessment accuracy and methodology validation
- Regulatory compliance verification against current requirements

### 6. Error Handling
**Error Categories**:
- **VALIDATION_ERROR**: Incomplete documentation or invalid product specifications
- **PROCESSING_ERROR**: Committee workflow or approval process failures
- **SYSTEM_ERROR**: Database or external system connectivity issues
- **TIMEOUT_ERROR**: Approval process exceeded timeout limits

**Error Recovery**:
- Retry approval workflow up to 2 times for transient failures
- Escalate to senior management for committee process failures
- Manual intervention workflow for critical system failures

**Error Propagation**:
- Return detailed error information to requesting department
- Generate alerts for product committee and risk management
- Log all errors with correlation IDs for audit purposes
