# DTCC Regulatory Reporting System Architecture

## Executive Summary

The DTCC Regulatory Reporting System is an event-driven, entity-centric platform built on the Cyoda EDBMS that processes OTC derivatives trades and manages regulatory reporting obligations to the DTCC Global Trade Repository (GTR). The system transforms incoming FpML trade confirmations into structured entities that progress through defined workflows to ensure regulatory compliance.

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Architecture Principles

1. **Entity-Driven Design**: All business data is modeled as entities with defined lifecycles
2. **Event-Driven Processing**: Business logic is triggered by events and state transitions
3. **Workflow-Based State Management**: Entity behavior is governed by finite state machines
4. **Immutable Audit Trail**: All state changes are permanently recorded
5. **Distributed Processing**: Scalable processing through asynchronous workflows

#### Entities as Event Sources
Entities hold their entire history as a sequence of entity changes. Entities can be reconstructed at any point in time by replaying their entity changes. All changes are linked to a transaction, such that the data lineage of any change can be traced back to their origins.

#### CQRS
The system does not need to incorporate the CQRS pattern, since the data held in the system is always consistent. All write operations are transactional and reads can be done either "as-at" point in time, or at the consistency time of the transaction, or at the current consistency time, or now (dirty read).

#### Saga Pattern
There is no need to implement the Saga pattern within the system itself. The system can be assumed to handle events transactionally such that the data remains consistent at all times. Only for interactions with external systems is a saga pattern eventually required. There is no eventual consistency for any of the data held by the system, it is consistent by its transactional design.

### Core Entity Types and Workflows

The system is built around entities that encapsulate both data and behavior through workflows. There are no separate processing engines - all business logic is embedded within entity workflows.

#### 1. Master Data Entities
- **Counterparty**: Legal entity information with validation and enrichment workflows
- **Product**: Financial instrument definitions with lifecycle management workflows
- **ReferenceData**: Market data and configuration with update and validation workflows
- **LegalEntity**: Organizational hierarchy with compliance and reporting workflows

#### 2. Transactional Entities
- **TradeConfirmation**: FpML message processing with validation, parsing, and conversion workflows
- **Trade**: Core trade data with lifecycle management, amendment, and cancellation workflows
- **Position**: Aggregated trade positions with calculation, reconciliation, and reporting workflows
- **Amendment**: Trade modification requests with validation, approval, and application workflows
- **Cancellation**: Trade termination requests with validation, approval, and processing workflows

#### 3. Regulatory Entities
- **RegulatoryReport**: DTCC GTR reports with generation, validation, and submission workflows
- **ReportingObligation**: Compliance tracking with monitoring, escalation, and resolution workflows
- **SubmissionStatus**: Report delivery tracking with retry, acknowledgment, and error handling workflows
- **AuditTrail**: Compliance history with archival and retrieval workflows

#### 4. Processing Control Entities
- **ProcessingBatch**: Batch operation coordination with initialization, monitoring, and completion workflows
- **ValidationResult**: Data quality assessment with scoring, review, and approval workflows
- **ReconciliationResult**: Position verification with comparison, exception handling, and resolution workflows

### Integration Points

#### External Systems
- **Trading Systems**: Source of FpML trade confirmations that trigger TradeConfirmation entity workflows
- **DTCC GTR**: Target for regulatory report submissions via RegulatoryReport entity workflows
- **Reference Data Providers**: Market data sources that update ReferenceData entity workflows
- **Risk Management Systems**: Consumers of Position entity data via API queries

#### Internal Interfaces
- **Entity APIs**: Direct entity query and management through Cyoda platform
- **Workflow Events**: Entity state transitions trigger downstream entity workflows
- **Scheduled Workflows**: Time-based entity processing for reconciliation and reporting
- **Monitoring Workflows**: Entity state monitoring and alerting through dedicated entities

## Entity Workflow Architecture

### Primary Entity Workflows

1. **Trade Confirmation Processing**
   ```
   FpML Message → TradeConfirmation Entity → Trade Entity → Position Entity → RegulatoryReport Entity
   ```

2. **Trade Amendment Processing**
   ```
   Amendment Request → Amendment Entity → Trade Entity Update → Position Recalculation → Report Update
   ```

3. **Regulatory Reporting Processing**
   ```
   Position Entity → RegulatoryReport Entity → SubmissionStatus Entity → AuditTrail Entity
   ```

### Entity State Transitions

- **TradeConfirmation.Validated**: Triggers Trade entity creation workflow
- **Trade.Active**: Triggers Position entity calculation workflow
- **Position.Updated**: Triggers RegulatoryReport entity generation workflow
- **RegulatoryReport.Generated**: Triggers SubmissionStatus entity workflow
- **SubmissionStatus.Failed**: Triggers retry workflow and alert entity creation

## Scalability and Performance

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Entity-Driven Architecture**: All business logic encapsulated in entity workflows enables stateless scaling
- **Workflow Partitioning**: Entity workflows partitioned by counterparty, product type, or processing batch
- **Concurrent Entity Processing**: Independent entity workflows execute concurrently across multiple nodes

### Performance Optimization
- **Entity Caching**: Frequently accessed entities cached for rapid state retrieval
- **Batch Entity Processing**: ProcessingBatch entities coordinate bulk operations efficiently
- **Asynchronous Workflows**: Long-running entity workflows execute asynchronously with state persistence

## Security and Compliance

### Data Security
- **Encryption at Rest**: All entity data encrypted in storage
- **Encryption in Transit**: All API communications use TLS
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to entity operations

### Regulatory Compliance
- **Audit Trail**: Complete immutable history of all entity changes
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies per regulatory requirements
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Automated tracking of reporting obligations

## Operational Considerations

### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Entity State Monitoring**: Track entities stuck in processing states
- **SLA Monitoring**: Alert on regulatory deadline violations
- **System Health**: Monitor processing throughput and error rates

### Disaster Recovery
- **Entity Backup**: Regular snapshots of entity database
- **Workflow Recovery**: Ability to resume processing from last known state
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Geographic distribution for business continuity

## Technology Stack

### Core Platform
- **Cyoda EDBMS**: Complete entity database, workflow engine, and event processing platform
- **Java/Spring Boot**: Application runtime for custom processors and criteria implementation
- **Cyoda Platform Services**: Built-in data persistence, event streaming, and workflow orchestration

### Supporting Technologies
- **Docker/Kubernetes**: Containerization and orchestration for Cyoda platform deployment
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Metrics collection and visualization for platform monitoring
- **ELK Stack**: Centralized logging and analysis for audit and debugging
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipeline automation for workflow and processor deployment

## Future Considerations

### Extensibility

- **Asset Class Expansion**: Support for additional derivative types
- **API Evolution**: Versioned APIs for backward compatibility

### Technology Evolution
- **Cloud Migration**: Preparation for cloud-native deployment
- **Machine Learning**: Anomaly detection and predictive analytics
- **Blockchain Integration**: Potential for distributed ledger integration
