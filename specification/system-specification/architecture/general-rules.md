# General Rules and Guiding Principles

## Structuring Results

- When creating results artefacts, use an appropriate directory structure. Avoid putting all results in a single directory.
- JSON Schemas for creating application pojos should be placed in `src/main/resources/schema/business/` directory. This should be self contained. Do not place any artefacts in `src/main/resources/schema/common/`
