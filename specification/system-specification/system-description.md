# DTCC Regulatory Reporting System Description

## System Overview

This system processes OTC derivatives trades and manages regulatory reporting obligations to the DTCC Global Trade Repository (GTR). Built on the Cyoda EDBMS platform, it operates as an entity-driven processing system where:

- **TradeConfirmation entities** process FpML trade confirmation messages through validation and conversion workflows
- **Trade and Position entities** maintain accurate trade positions through automated aggregation and reconciliation workflows
- **Entity workflows manage the complete lifecycle** of trade data from confirmation through position keeping to regulatory submission
- **RegulatoryReport entities** ensure compliance by automatically generating and submitting required reports to DTCC GTR within mandated timeframes
- **Master data entities** (Counterparty, Product, ReferenceData) maintain necessary information through validation and enrichment workflows
- **All processing is entity-driven** where business logic is encapsulated within entity workflows and state machines, with no separate processing engines

## Business Context

The system handles the complexities of OTC derivatives markets including trade amendments, cancellations, position netting, and regulatory reporting across multiple jurisdictions. It serves trading desks, operations teams, compliance officers, and regulatory bodies by providing accurate, timely, and auditable trade and position data.

## Key Business Objectives

- Ensure 100% regulatory compliance with DTCC reporting requirements
- Provide real-time position visibility and risk management capabilities  
- Maintain complete audit trails for all trade and position changes
- Enable straight-through processing from trade confirmation to regulatory submission
- Support multiple asset classes and jurisdictions within OTC derivatives markets

## Architecture Principles

The system shall be built using the Cyoda EDBMS entity-driven architecture where:
- All business data is modeled as entities with defined lifecycles and workflows
- Business logic is encapsulated within entity workflows, not separate processing engines
- Entity state transitions trigger automated workflows while maintaining complete audit trails
- External integrations interact directly with entity workflows through well-defined interfaces
- Scalability is achieved through distributed entity processing across the Cyoda platform
- There are no special engines that process events - the Cyoda platform processes events based on defined entity workflows and state machines

### Reference Documents

This system specification shall be based on the following foundational documents:

- **[Cyoda Design Principles](../cyoda-design-principles.md)** - Core architectural patterns and entity-driven design principles for the Cyoda platform
- **[Workflow Configuration Guide](../workflow-config-guide.md)** - Technical specification for defining entity workflows and state machines using Cyoda JSON schema
