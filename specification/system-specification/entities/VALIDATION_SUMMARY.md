- **ReconciliationResult.json** - Results of reconciliation processes between internal and external data

### ✅ 6. Comprehensive Documentation (3 files)
- **README.md** - Complete overview and usage guide for all business entity schemas
- **schema-documentation.md** - Comprehensive field descriptions, business rules, and validation requirements

### Data Integrity Features
- **Required Field Validation** for critical business data
- **Format Validation** using regex patterns for structured data
- **Cross-Reference Validation** between related entities
- **Enumeration Constraints** for controlled vocabularies
- **Range Validation** for numeric fields

### Workflow Integration

- **Transition History** tracking with actor information
- **Manual/Automatic Transition** support
- **Terminal State** identification
- **Error State** handling

### Performance Optimization
- **Business Key Indexing** support through businessKey field
- **Minimal Required Fields** to reduce processing overhead
- **Efficient Schema Structure** for high-volume processing
- **Extensible Design** for future requirements

### Audit and Compliance

   - Set up validation rules

2. **Integration with existing systems**
   - Map schemas to database structures
   - Implement API endpoints
   - Configure message processing

3. **Testing and validation**
   - Unit tests for schema validation
   - Integration tests with sample data
   - Performance testing with realistic volumes

4. **Production deployment**
