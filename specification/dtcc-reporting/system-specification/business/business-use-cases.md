Paul Muadib, I have created the comprehensive business use cases document. This covers all the primary business scenarios that the DTCC reporting system must support, including detailed flows, success criteria, failure scenarios, and timing requirements.

Next, I should create the high-level event flow diagrams for each major use case as specified in the plan. Would you like me to proceed with creating the event flow diagrams using Mermaid notation?
