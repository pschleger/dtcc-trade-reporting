# isReportingSuccessful Criterion Specification

## 1. Component Overview
**Component Name**: isReportingSuccessful
**Component Type**: CyodaCriterion
**Business Domain**: Processing Status Evaluation
**Purpose**: Evaluates whether regulatory reporting process completed successfully with all required reports submitted
**Workflow Context**: RegulatoryReportingWorkflow (reporting state transitions)

## 2. Input Parameters
**Entity Type**: ReportingRequest
**Required Fields**:
- `reportingStatus`: string - Current reporting status
- `reportingResults`: object - Detailed reporting results
- `reportingTimestamp`: ISO-8601 timestamp - When reporting completed
- `submissionRate`: decimal - Report submission success rate (0.0-1.0)
- `reportSubmissions`: object - Details of submitted reports

**Optional Fields**:
- `reportingErrors`: array - List of reporting errors if any
- `reportingWarnings`: array - Non-critical reporting warnings
- `performanceMetrics`: object - Reporting performance data

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `attachEntity`: true - Attach entity to evaluation context
- `calculationNodesTags`: "reporting" - Tags for reporting evaluation nodes
- `responseTimeoutMs`: 5000 - Maximum evaluation time (5 seconds)
- `context`: "reporting-success-check" - Evaluation context identifier

**Evaluation Context**:
- Submission rate thresholds
- Report submission requirements
- Performance benchmarks

## 3. Evaluation Logic
**Decision Algorithm**:
```
IF reportingStatus == "SUCCESS" AND
   reportingResults != null AND
   submissionRate >= threshold AND
   reportSubmissions.allSubmitted == true AND
   reportingTimestamp within acceptable range THEN
    RETURN true
ELSE IF reportingStatus == "FAILED" OR
        reportingErrors.length > 0 OR
        submissionRate < threshold THEN
    RETURN false
ELSE
    RETURN false (default to safe state)
```

**Boolean Logic**:
- Primary evaluation based on reporting status
- Secondary evaluation considers submission rate
- Tertiary evaluation validates report submissions
- Temporal validation ensures recent reporting

**Calculation Methods**:
- Submission rate threshold comparison
- Report submission validation
- Temporal freshness calculation

## 4. Success Conditions
**Positive Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Reporting Status**: reportingStatus equals "SUCCESS"
- **Results Present**: reportingResults contains required submission data
- **Submission Rate**: submissionRate >= 0.98 (configurable threshold)
- **All Submitted**: reportSubmissions.allSubmitted is true
- **Temporal Validity**: reportingTimestamp within last 10 minutes

**Success Scenarios**:
- **Standard Success**: All required reports submitted with high success rate
- **Partial Success**: Critical reports submitted with acceptable rate
- **Threshold Success**: Reporting passes at minimum acceptable submission rate

## 5. Failure Conditions
**Negative Evaluation Criteria**:
- **Reporting Failure**: reportingStatus equals "FAILED" or "ERROR"
- **Missing Results**: reportingResults is null or incomplete
- **Submission Issues**: submissionRate < 0.98 without approved exceptions
- **Unsubmitted Reports**: reportSubmissions.allSubmitted is false
- **Stale Reporting**: reportingTimestamp older than 10 minutes

**Failure Scenarios**:
- **Submission Failure**: Unable to submit critical reports
- **Rate Failure**: Submission rate below acceptable threshold
- **Timeout Failure**: Reporting process timed out before completion
- **System Failure**: Technical errors during reporting processing

## 6. Edge Cases
**Boundary Conditions**:
- **Large Report Sets**: Performance degradation with large report volumes
- **Threshold Boundaries**: Submission rate exactly at threshold
- **Time Boundaries**: Reporting timestamp at edge of acceptable range
- **Concurrent Reporting**: Multiple reporting requests for same period

**Special Scenarios**:
- **Emergency Processing**: Manual override for critical business needs
- **System Maintenance**: Degraded reporting during maintenance windows
- **Market Closure**: Different reporting requirements during market closure

**Data Absence Handling**:
- Missing reportingStatus defaults to false evaluation
- Missing reportingResults treated as reporting failure
- Missing submissionRate uses conservative threshold

## 7. Performance Requirements
**SLA Requirements**:
- **Evaluation Time**: 1 second (95th percentile)
- **Throughput**: 400 evaluations per second
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime during business hours

**Resource Requirements**:
- **CPU**: Low intensity for boolean logic evaluation
- **Memory**: 64MB per concurrent evaluation

## 8. Dependencies
**Internal Dependencies**:
- **Reporting Service**: Access to reporting results and status
- **Submission Service**: Information about report submissions
- **Configuration Service**: Submission rate thresholds and requirements

**External Dependencies**:
- **Audit Service**: Reporting history and performance tracking
- **DTCC GTR**: External regulatory reporting system

**Data Dependencies**:
- Submission rate threshold configuration
- Report submission configuration
- Performance benchmark settings

## 9. Configuration
**Configurable Thresholds**:
- `submissionRateThreshold`: decimal - Minimum submission rate - Default: 0.98
- `reportingTimeoutMinutes`: integer - Maximum reporting age - Default: 10
- `allowPartialSubmission`: boolean - Accept partial submission results - Default: false

**Evaluation Parameters**:
- `strictMode`: boolean - Enable strict evaluation mode - Default: true
- `warningsAsErrors`: boolean - Treat warnings as errors - Default: false
- `performanceValidation`: boolean - Include performance validation - Default: true

**Environment-Specific Settings**:
- Development: Relaxed thresholds, extended timeout
- Production: Strict thresholds, standard timeout

## 10. Error Handling
**Evaluation Errors**:
- **DATA_UNAVAILABLE**: Required reporting data not accessible
- **EVALUATION_TIMEOUT**: Evaluation exceeded timeout limit
- **CONFIGURATION_ERROR**: Invalid evaluation configuration
- **SYSTEM_ERROR**: Technical evaluation failure

**Error Recovery**:
- Default to false evaluation on data unavailability
- Retry mechanism for transient system errors (max 2 retries)
- Fallback to cached results for minor system issues

**Error Propagation**:
- Evaluation errors logged with reporting context
- Failed evaluations trigger manual review workflow
- Critical errors escalated to operations team
