### Requirements Compliance ✅

#### 1. Schema Requirements
- ✅ All workflows include required properties: `version`, `name`, `initialState`, `states`
- ✅ All workflows use schema version "1.0"
- ✅ All state names start with letters and use only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens
- ✅ All initial states exist in the states definition

#### 2. Criteria Types
- ✅ All criteria use "function" type (no "simple" types as specified)
- ✅ Function-based criteria include proper configuration with `attachEntity`, `calculationNodesTags`, and `context`
- ✅ No deprecated "simple" criteria types found

#### 3. Process Parameters
- ✅ All workflows include `processParams` blocks
- ✅ All process parameter IDs use time UUID format (01932b4e-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx)
- ✅ Process parameters include descriptive names, descriptions, and types
- ✅ Process parameters are referenced in processor configurations via `processParamId`

#### 4. Execution Modes
- ✅ SYNC: Used for validation and quick operations
- ✅ ASYNC_NEW_TX: Used for long-running operations and external integrations
- ✅ ASYNC_SAME_TX: Used for monitoring and progress tracking

#### 5. Manual vs Automated Transitions
- ✅ Manual transitions: User approvals, error recovery, escalations
- ✅ Automated transitions: System processing, validations, scheduled operations
- ✅ Proper `manual` flag configuration throughout all workflows

#### 6. Error Handling
- ✅ All workflows include failure states for different error types
- ✅ Manual review states for complex issue resolution
- ✅ Retry mechanisms with configurable limits
- ✅ Notification processors for operational alerts

## Business Use Case Coverage ✅

### Trade Processing (UC-001 to UC-003)
- ✅ TradeConfirmationWorkflow: FpML message processing
- ✅ TradeWorkflow: Complete trade lifecycle management
- ✅ AmendmentWorkflow: Trade amendment processing
- ✅ CancellationWorkflow: Trade cancellation processing

### Position Management (UC-004 to UC-005)
- ✅ PositionWorkflow: Real-time position calculation and reporting
- ✅ ReconciliationResultWorkflow: Position reconciliation and discrepancy resolution

### Regulatory Reporting (UC-006 to UC-007)
- ✅ RegulatoryReportWorkflow: DTCC GTR report generation and submission

### Reference Data Management (UC-008 to UC-009)
- ✅ CounterpartyWorkflow: Counterparty master data lifecycle
- ✅ ProductWorkflow: Product reference data management

### Exception Handling (UC-010 to UC-011)
- ✅ ProcessingBatchWorkflow: Batch processing coordination
- ✅ Cross-cutting error handling in all workflows

## Technical Validation ✅

### State Machine Design
- ✅ All workflows have proper entry points (initial states)
- ✅ Terminal states clearly identified
- ✅ No unreachable states detected
- ✅ Proper state transition logic

### Processor Configuration
- ✅ All processors include required configuration parameters
- ✅ Timeout values appropriate for operation types
- ✅ Calculation node tags for workload distribution
- ✅ Entity attachment configuration

### Function Integration
- ✅ All function names follow consistent naming conventions
- ✅ Context parameters provided for function execution
- ✅ Proper error handling for function failures

## Performance Considerations ✅

### Timeout Configuration
- ✅ Short timeouts (5-15s) for validation operations
- ✅ Medium timeouts (30-60s) for processing operations
- ✅ Long timeouts (120-180s) for complex operations and external integrations

### Execution Distribution
- ✅ Synchronous execution for critical path operations
- ✅ Asynchronous execution for long-running and external operations
- ✅ Proper transaction boundary management

### Retry Mechanisms
- ✅ Automatic retry for transient failures
- ✅ Exponential backoff for external system interactions
- ✅ Manual intervention for persistent failures

## Security and Compliance ✅

### Audit Trail
- ✅ All state transitions logged automatically
- ✅ Manual intervention points tracked
- ✅ Error conditions and resolutions recorded

### Access Control
- ✅ Manual transitions require appropriate authorization
- ✅ Sensitive operations (suspension, archival) properly controlled
- ✅ Escalation paths for complex issues

## Deployment Readiness ✅

### Configuration Validation
- ✅ All JSON files are valid and well-formed
- ✅ Schema compliance verified
- ✅ No syntax errors detected

### Integration Points
- ✅ External function names documented
- ✅ Calculation node tags defined
- ✅ Notification mechanisms configured

### Monitoring Setup
- ✅ Error states identified for alerting
- ✅ Performance metrics available through timeouts
- ✅ Progress tracking through state transitions

## Recommendations
