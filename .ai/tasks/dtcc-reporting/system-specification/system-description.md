# DTCC Regulatory Reporting System Description

## System Overview

This system processes OTC derivatives trades and manages regulatory reporting obligations to the DTCC Global Trade Repository (GTR). It serves as a comprehensive post-trade processing platform that:

- **Ingests FpML trade confirmation messages** from trading systems and counterparties
- **Builds and maintains accurate trade positions** through real-time aggregation and reconciliation
- **Manages the complete lifecycle** of trade data from confirmation through position keeping to regulatory submission
- **Ensures regulatory compliance** by automatically generating and submitting required reports to DTCC GTR within mandated timeframes
- **Maintains counterparty and reference data** necessary for accurate reporting and position calculation
- **Operates on an event-driven architecture** where business logic is encapsulated in entity workflows, enabling scalable and auditable processing

## Business Context

The system handles the complexities of OTC derivatives markets including trade amendments, cancellations, position netting, and regulatory reporting across multiple jurisdictions. It serves trading desks, operations teams, compliance officers, and regulatory bodies by providing accurate, timely, and auditable trade and position data.

## Key Business Objectives

- Ensure 100% regulatory compliance with DTCC reporting requirements
- Provide real-time position visibility and risk management capabilities  
- Maintain complete audit trails for all trade and position changes
- Enable straight-through processing from trade confirmation to regulatory submission
- Support multiple asset classes and jurisdictions within OTC derivatives markets

## Architecture Principles

The system shall be built using an event-driven architecture where:
- Business logic is encapsulated within entity workflows using the Cyoda platform
- All processing follows defined state machines with clear transition criteria
- Events trigger automated processing chains while maintaining audit trails
- External integrations are managed through well-defined interfaces
- Scalability is achieved through distributed processing capabilities

### Reference Documents

This system specification shall be based on the following foundational documents:

- **[Cyoda Design Principles](../cyoda-design-principles.md)** - Core architectural patterns and entity-driven design principles for the Cyoda platform
- **[Workflow Configuration Guide](../workflow-config-guide.md)** - Technical specification for defining entity workflows and state machines using Cyoda JSON schema
