# DTCC Regulatory Reporting System Architecture

## Executive Summary

The DTCC Regulatory Reporting System is an event-driven, entity-centric platform built on the Cyoda EDBMS that processes OTC derivatives trades and manages regulatory reporting obligations to the DTCC Global Trade Repository (GTR). The system transforms incoming FpML trade confirmations into structured entities that progress through defined workflows to ensure regulatory compliance.

## System Architecture Overview

### Core Architecture Principles

1. **Entity-Driven Design**: All business data is modeled as entities with defined lifecycles
2. **Event-Driven Processing**: Business logic is triggered by events and state transitions
3. **Workflow-Based State Management**: Entity behavior is governed by finite state machines
4. **Immutable Audit Trail**: All state changes are permanently recorded
5. **Distributed Processing**: Scalable processing through asynchronous workflows

#### Entities as Event Sources
Entities hold their entire history as a sequence of entity changes. Entities can be reconstructed at any point in time by replaying their entity changes. All changes are linked to a transaction, such that the data lineage of any change can be traced back to their origins.

#### CQRS
The system does not need to incorporate the CQRS pattern, since the data held in the system is always consistent. All write operations are transactional and reads can be done either "as-at" point in time, or at the consistency time of the transaction, or at the current consistency time, or now (dirty read).

#### Saga Pattern
There is no need to implement the Saga pattern within the system itself. The system can be assumed to handle events transactionally such that the data remains consistent at all times. Only for interactions with external systems is a saga pattern eventually required. There is no eventual consistency for any of the data held by the system, it is consistent by its transactional design.

### High-Level System Components

#### 1. Ingestion Layer
- **FpML Message Processor**: Receives and validates incoming trade confirmations
- **Message Router**: Routes messages to appropriate processing workflows
- **Data Validation Engine**: Ensures message integrity and business rule compliance

#### 2. Entity Processing Layer
- **Trade Processing Engine**: Converts FpML messages to Trade entities
- **Position Calculation Engine**: Aggregates trades into position entities
- **Amendment/Cancellation Processor**: Handles trade lifecycle events
- **Reference Data Manager**: Maintains counterparty and product master data

#### 3. Regulatory Reporting Layer
- **Report Generation Engine**: Creates DTCC GTR compliant reports
- **Submission Manager**: Manages report delivery to regulatory authorities
- **Compliance Monitor**: Tracks reporting obligations and deadlines
- **Audit Trail Manager**: Maintains complete processing history

#### 4. Data Persistence Layer
- **Cyoda Entity Database**: Stores all entities with full versioning
- **Workflow State Store**: Maintains entity state and transition history
- **Reference Data Store**: Caches frequently accessed master data

### Integration Points

#### External Systems
- **Trading Systems**: Source of FpML trade confirmations
- **DTCC GTR**: Target for regulatory report submissions
- **Reference Data Providers**: Market data and counterparty information
- **Risk Management Systems**: Position and exposure data consumers

#### Internal Interfaces
- **REST APIs**: Entity query and management interfaces
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time event publication for downstream systems
- **Batch Processing**: Scheduled reconciliation and reporting jobs
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Operational health and compliance monitoring

## Data Flow Architecture

### Primary Data Flows

1. **Trade Ingestion Flow**
   ```
   FpML Message → Validation → Trade Entity → Position Update → Regulatory Report
   ```

2. **Amendment Flow**
   ```
   Amendment Message → Trade Lookup → Position Recalculation → Report Update
   ```

3. **Regulatory Reporting Flow**
   ```
   Position Entity → Report Generation → Submission → Status Tracking
   ```

### Event-Driven Interactions

- **Trade Confirmed**: Triggers position calculation and regulatory assessment
- **Position Updated**: Triggers report generation if thresholds met
- **Report Generated**: Triggers submission workflow
- **Submission Failed**: Triggers retry and alerting workflows

## Scalability and Performance

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Stateless Processing**: All business logic encapsulated in entity workflows
- **Event Partitioning**: Messages partitioned by counterparty or product type
- **Parallel Processing**: Independent entity workflows enable concurrent execution

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Frequently accessed reference data cached in memory
- **Batch Processing**: Non-urgent operations batched for efficiency
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Long-running operations executed asynchronously

## Security and Compliance

### Data Security
- **Encryption at Rest**: All entity data encrypted in storage
- **Encryption in Transit**: All API communications use TLS
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to entity operations

### Regulatory Compliance
- **Audit Trail**: Complete immutable history of all entity changes
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies per regulatory requirements
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Automated tracking of reporting obligations

## Operational Considerations

### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Entity State Monitoring**: Track entities stuck in processing states
- **SLA Monitoring**: Alert on regulatory deadline violations
- **System Health**: Monitor processing throughput and error rates

### Disaster Recovery
- **Entity Backup**: Regular snapshots of entity database
- **Workflow Recovery**: Ability to resume processing from last known state
- **Cross-Region Replication**: Geographic distribution for business continuity

## Technology Stack

### Core Platform
- **Cyoda EDBMS**: Entity database and workflow engine
- **Java/Spring Boot**: Application runtime and dependency injection
- **PostgreSQL**: Underlying data persistence
- **Apache Kafka**: Event streaming and message queuing

### Supporting Technologies
- **Docker/Kubernetes**: Containerization and orchestration
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Metrics collection and visualization
- **ELK Stack**: Centralized logging and analysis
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD pipeline automation

## Future Considerations

### Extensibility
- **Multi-Jurisdiction Support**: Framework for additional regulatory regimes
- **Asset Class Expansion**: Support for additional derivative types
- **API Evolution**: Versioned APIs for backward compatibility

### Technology Evolution
- **Cloud Migration**: Preparation for cloud-native deployment
- **Machine Learning**: Anomaly detection and predictive analytics
- **Blockchain Integration**: Potential for distributed ledger integration
