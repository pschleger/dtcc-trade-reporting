# Event-Driven Architecture Principles

## Overview

The DTCC Regulatory Reporting System implements a comprehensive event-driven architecture where business logic is encapsulated within entity workflows. This approach ensures scalable, auditable, and maintainable processing while maintaining strict regulatory compliance requirements.

## Core Event-Driven Principles

### 1. Entity-Centric Event Model
All events in the system are generated by and targeted at specific entities. Events represent meaningful business state changes rather than technical system operations.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Events are immutable records of business facts
- Each event contains complete context for processing
- Events maintain causal relationships through correlation IDs
- Event ordering is preserved within entity boundaries

### 2. Workflow-Driven Processing
Business logic is encoded in entity workflows that respond to events through state transitions. This ensures consistent, predictable processing behavior.

**Workflow Principles:**
- Each entity type has a defined finite state machine
- State transitions are triggered by events
- Criteria guard transitions to ensure business rule compliance
- Processors execute business logic during transitions

### 3. Asynchronous Processing
The system favors asynchronous processing to achieve scalability and resilience while maintaining strong consistency guarantees within entity boundaries.

**Asynchronous Benefits:**
- Improved system throughput and responsiveness
- Natural fault isolation between processing components
- Ability to handle varying load patterns
- Support for long-running business processes

## Event Categories

### Business Events
Events that represent meaningful business occurrences in the OTC derivatives trading lifecycle.

#### Trade Lifecycle Events
- **TradeConfirmationReceived**: New FpML message ingested
- **TradeValidated**: Trade passes all validation rules
- **TradeConfirmed**: Trade officially confirmed by counterparties
- **TradeAmended**: Existing trade modified
- **TradeCancelled**: Trade cancelled before maturity
- **TradeMatured**: Trade reached natural expiration

#### Position Events
- **PositionCalculationTriggered**: Position recalculation initiated
- **PositionUpdated**: Position values recalculated
- **PositionThresholdBreached**: Regulatory reporting threshold exceeded
- **PositionReconciled**: Position reconciliation completed

#### Regulatory Events
- **ReportingObligationIdentified**: New regulatory requirement detected
- **ReportGenerated**: Regulatory report created
- **ReportSubmitted**: Report sent to regulatory authority
- **ReportAcknowledged**: Submission confirmed by authority
- **ReportRejected**: Submission rejected by authority
- **ComplianceDeadlineApproaching**: Regulatory deadline warning

### System Events
Events that coordinate system operations and maintain operational health.

#### Processing Events
- **BatchProcessingStarted**: Batch operation initiated
- **BatchProcessingCompleted**: Batch operation finished
- **ValidationCompleted**: Data validation finished
- **ReconciliationCompleted**: Data reconciliation finished

#### Integration Events
- **ExternalSystemConnected**: External system integration established
- **ExternalSystemDisconnected**: External system integration lost
- **DataSynchronizationCompleted**: Reference data updated
- **APIRequestReceived**: External API call processed

## Event Processing Patterns

### 1. Transactional Event Processing
The system processes events transactionally, ensuring strong consistency across all entity mutations within the system boundaries.

**Characteristics:**
- Events trigger entity state transitions within single transactions
- Business logic enforced through workflow criteria
- Strong consistency maintained across all internal entities
- No eventual consistency for internal data

**Benefits:**
- Simplified reasoning about data consistency
- Immediate consistency for all business operations
- Reduced complexity in error handling
- Guaranteed data integrity for regulatory compliance

### 2. Entity Change History
All entity state changes are captured as a sequence of entity changes, providing complete audit trails and enabling temporal queries.

**Benefits:**
- Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance
- Ability to reconstruct entity state at any point in time
- Support for temporal business queries
- Natural support for change replay and debugging

**Implementation:**
- Entity changes stored in immutable history log
- Entity state reconstructed by replaying entity changes
- Current state maintained for performance optimization
- Entity change versioning supports schema evolution

### 3. External System Integration Pattern
Long-running processes that involve external systems use saga-like coordination patterns to manage distributed transactions across system boundaries.

**Use Cases:**
- DTCC GTR report submission and acknowledgment
- External reference data synchronization
- Trading system integration and confirmation
- Third-party validation services

**Implementation:**
- Choreography-based coordination for external interactions
- Compensation actions for external system failures
- Timeout handling for external system responses
- Progress tracking and monitoring for external processes

## Event Schema Design

### Event Structure
All events follow a consistent schema that supports routing, processing, and audit requirements.

```json
{
  "eventId": "uuid",
  "eventType": "string",
  "entityType": "string", 
  "entityId": "string",
  "timestamp": "iso8601",
  "version": "semver",
  "correlationId": "uuid",
  "causationId": "uuid",
  "actorId": "string",
  "payload": {
    // Event-specific data
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source": "string",
    "traceId": "string",
    "businessContext": {}
  }
}
```

### Event Versioning
Events support schema evolution through semantic versioning to maintain backward compatibility.

**Versioning Strategy:**
- Major version changes for breaking schema changes
- Minor version changes for additive schema changes
- Patch version changes for non-functional updates
- Event processors handle multiple event versions

## Event Processing Guarantees

### Delivery Guarantees
- **At-least-once delivery**: Events may be delivered multiple times
- **Idempotent processing**: Duplicate event processing produces same result
- **Ordering preservation**: Events maintain order within entity boundaries
- **Durability**: Events persisted before acknowledgment

### Consistency Guarantees
- **Strong consistency**: Across all internal entities and system boundaries
- **Transactional consistency**: All entity mutations processed within transactions
- **Causal consistency**: Related events maintain causal ordering
- **Monotonic consistency**: Entity state progresses monotonically

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Error Categories
1. **Transient Errors**: Temporary failures that may succeed on retry
2. **Business Errors**: Violations of business rules requiring manual intervention
3. **System Errors**: Infrastructure failures requiring operational response
4. **Data Errors**: Corrupt or invalid data requiring data remediation

### Recovery Strategies
- **Automatic Retry**: Exponential backoff for transient errors
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Failed events routed for manual investigation
- **Compensation**: Rollback actions for failed multi-step processes
- **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascade failures in downstream systems

## Monitoring and Observability

### Event Metrics
- Event processing throughput and latency
- Error rates by event type and processor
- Queue depths and processing backlogs
- Business process completion rates

### Distributed Tracing
- End-to-end trace correlation across entity boundaries
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error propagation analysis
- Business process flow visualization

### Business Monitoring
- Regulatory compliance metrics
- SLA adherence tracking
- Business process health indicators
- Anomaly detection and alerting

## Integration Patterns

### External System Integration
- **Event-driven APIs**: Publish events for external consumption
- **Webhook Integration**: Receive events from external systems
- **Message Queue Integration**: Reliable message exchange
- **Batch Integration**: Scheduled data synchronization

### Internal System Coordination
- **Event Bus**: Central event routing and distribution
- **Entity History Store**: Persistent entity change storage and replay
- **Event Processors**: Transactional event handling components
- **Entity Views**: Consistent entity state representations
