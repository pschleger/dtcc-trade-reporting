# Architecture Corrections Summary

## Problem Identified

The original system architecture documents contained fundamental discrepancies with the Cyoda EDBMS platform principles. The main issue was that the architecture described traditional "processing engines" and layered components, which contradicts the core Cyoda principle that **there are no special engines that process events** - instead, events are processed by the Cyoda platform based on defined entity workflows and state machines.

## Key Architectural Principle Violations Corrected

### 1. Processing Engines Removed
**Before**: System described separate processing engines:
- FpML Message Processor
- Trade Processing Engine  
- Position Calculation Engine
- Report Generation Engine
- Submission Manager

**After**: All processing is now correctly described as entity workflows:
- TradeConfirmation entity workflows
- Trade entity workflows
- Position entity workflows
- RegulatoryReport entity workflows

### 2. Layered Architecture Replaced
**Before**: Traditional layered architecture with:
- Ingestion Layer
- Entity Processing Layer
- Regulatory Reporting Layer
- Data Persistence Layer

**After**: Entity-driven architecture with:
- Core entity types with embedded workflows
- Cyoda EDBMS platform services
- Entity state machines and transitions

### 3. Event Processing Clarified
**Before**: Implied separate event processing systems
**After**: All events processed through entity workflows managed by the Cyoda platform

## Documents Updated

**Changes Made**:
- Removed layered architecture components
- Added Cyoda EDBMS Platform section with workflow engine, entity database, and state machine
- Updated connections to show entity workflows instead of processing flows
- Changed styling to reflect entity-driven approach

### 3. System Description
**File**: `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/system-description.md`

**Changes Made**:
- Updated system overview to emphasize entity-driven processing
- Clarified that there are no separate processing engines
- Updated architecture principles to align with Cyoda EDBMS principles
- Added explicit statement about no special engines processing events

### 4. Component Interaction Diagrams
**File**: `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/functional-specifications/component-interaction-diagrams.md`

**Changes Made**:
- Renamed to "Entity Workflow Interaction Diagrams"
- Updated all workflow diagrams to show entity state transitions
- Added entity state machine diagrams
- Changed summary to focus on entity workflow patterns
- Updated performance and error handling to reflect entity-driven approach

### 5. New Entity-Driven Architecture Document
**File**: `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/architecture/entity-driven-architecture.md`

**New Document Created**:
- Comprehensive explanation of Cyoda EDBMS entity-driven architecture
- Clear statement that there are no processing engines
- Detailed entity workflow interactions
- Platform integration guidelines
- Implementation best practices

### 6. README Updates
**File**: `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/README.md`

**Changes Made**:
- Added reference to new entity-driven architecture document
- Updated navigation guide to prioritize entity-driven architecture
- Updated document status table

## Key Corrections Made

### 1. Terminology Corrections
- **Before**: "Processing engines", "processors", "managers"
- **After**: "Entity workflows", "entity state machines", "workflow transitions"

### 2. Architecture Pattern Corrections
- **Before**: Layered architecture with separate processing components
- **After**: Entity-driven architecture with embedded workflow logic

### 3. Event Processing Corrections
- **Before**: Separate event processing systems
- **After**: Entity workflows triggered by state transitions

### 4. Integration Corrections
- **Before**: API calls to processing engines
- **After**: Entity API interactions and workflow event triggers

### 5. Scalability Corrections
- **Before**: Horizontal scaling of processing components
- **After**: Distributed entity workflow processing across platform nodes

## Validation of Corrections

### 1. Alignment with Cyoda Design Principles
✅ All business logic now encapsulated in entity workflows
✅ No separate processing engines described
✅ Event processing handled by Cyoda platform
✅ Entity state machines drive all business logic

### 2. Consistency Across Documents
✅ System description aligns with architecture documents
✅ Diagrams reflect entity-driven approach
✅ Component interactions show entity workflows
✅ All references to engines removed

### 3. Technical Accuracy
✅ Cyoda EDBMS platform correctly described
✅ Entity workflows properly modeled
✅ State machines accurately represented
✅ Platform services correctly identified

## Impact Assessment

### 1. Functional Specifications
- Workflow configurations remain valid as they already follow entity-driven patterns
- Processor and criteria definitions align with entity workflow implementation
- No changes needed to existing workflow JSON files

### 2. Schema Definitions
- Entity schemas remain unchanged as they were already correctly modeled
- Workflow schemas align with corrected architecture
- No impact on existing entity definitions

### 3. Implementation Guidance
- Development teams now have clear entity-driven architecture guidance
- Platform utilization guidelines provided
- Implementation patterns clarified

## Conclusion

The architecture corrections successfully align the DTCC Regulatory Reporting System specification with Cyoda EDBMS platform principles. The system is now correctly described as an entity-driven architecture where all business logic is encapsulated within entity workflows, with no separate processing engines. This provides a solid foundation for implementation that leverages the full capabilities of the Cyoda platform while maintaining regulatory compliance and business requirements.
