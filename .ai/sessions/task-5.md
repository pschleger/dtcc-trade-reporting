### 12:22 PM - Execute Workflow Configuration Plan

**Command**: `execute @/.ai/plans/5-Create-Detailed-Workflow-Configurations.md`

**Response**:
```
execute @5-Create-Detailed-Workflow-Configurations.md

I'll start by examining the plan file to understand what needs to be executed.
```

**Action**: Read file `5-Create-Detailed-Workflow-Configurations.md` from `.ai/plans`

**Response**:
```
Now I need to examine the WorkflowConfiguration.json schema to understand the structure and requirements:
```

**Action**: Read file `WorkflowConfiguration.json` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/schema/common/statemachine/conf`

**Response**:
```
Let me examine the StateDefinition schema to understand the state structure:
```

**Action**: Read file `StateDefinition.json` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/schema/common/statemachine/conf`

**Response**:
```
Let me examine the TransitionDefinition schema:
```

**Action**: Read file `TransitionDefinition.json` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/schema/common/statemachine/conf`

**Response**:
```
Let me examine the ExternalizedProcessorDefinition schema:
```

**Action**: Read file `ExternalizedProcessorDefinition.json` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/schema/common/statemachine/conf`

**Response**:
```
Let me examine the QueryCondition schema to understand the criterion structure:
```

**Action**: Read file `QueryCondition.json` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/schema/common/condition`

**Response**:
```
Now let me check the existing workflow designs from Task 4 to understand what needs to be implemented:
```

**Action**: Read directory `dtcc-reporting` from `.ai/tasks`

**Response**:
```
Let me check the workflow designs from the system specification:
```

**Action**: Read directory `workflows` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification`

**Response**:
```
Let me examine the workflow state machines document to understand the high-level designs:
```

**Action**: Read file `workflow-state-machines.md` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/workflows`

**Response**:
```
Now let me check the use case workflow mapping to understand the requirements:
```

**Action**: Read file `use-case-workflow-mapping.md` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/workflows`

**Response**:
```
Now let me check the workflow configuration guide to understand the specific requirements:
```

**Action**: Read file `workflow-config-guide.md` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting`

**Response**:
```
Now I need to check if there are any existing workflow configurations to understand the current structure:
```

**Action**: Augment Context Engine
```
Find any existing workflow configuration JSON files in the codebase, particularly looking for examples of Cyoda workflow configurations that follow the WorkflowConfiguration.json schema
```

**Response**:
```
Now I need to understand the process parameters requirement. Let me check for information about time UUIDs and processParams:
```

**Action**: Augment Context Engine
```
Find information about processParams blocks in workflow configurations, time UUIDs for process parameters, and any examples of how process parameters should be structured in Cyoda workflows
```

**Response**:
```
Based on my analysis, I need to understand the processParams requirement better. Let me check the memories for specific information about processParams:
```

**Action**: Augment Context Engine
```
Find information about processParams blocks in workflow JSON files, specifically looking for examples of how process parameters are structured with time UUIDs and how they relate to the processes section in workflow configurations
```

**Response**:
```
Based on my analysis, I understand that the plan requires creating processParams blocks with time UUIDs, but the schema doesn't explicitly show processParams as a top-level property. From the memories, I understand that Paul Muadib requires process parameters to use time UUIDs and be included in both the processes section and separately in processParams blocks. Let me create a detailed plan and start implementing the workflow configurations.
```

### Detailed Plan for Creating Workflow Configurations

**Response**:
```
Paul Muadib, I'll now create detailed workflow configurations for the DTCC reporting system. Based on my analysis of the requirements and schema, here's my plan:

Implementation Plan:
1. Create TradeConfirmation Workflow - Process incoming FpML messages
2. Create Trade Workflow - Manage trade lifecycle
3. Create Position Workflow - Calculate and maintain positions
4. Create RegulatoryReport Workflow - Generate and submit reports
5. Create Counterparty Workflow - Manage counterparty data
6. Create Product Workflow - Manage product reference data
7. Create Amendment Workflow - Process trade amendments
8. Create Cancellation Workflow - Process trade cancellations
9. Create ReconciliationResult Workflow - Execute reconciliation processes
10. Create ProcessingBatch Workflow - Coordinate batch operations

Each workflow will include:
- Function-based criteria (avoiding "simple" type as specified)
- Time UUIDs for process parameters
- ProcessParams blocks
- Proper execution modes (SYNC/ASYNC)
- Manual vs automated transitions
- Complete state machines with error handling

Let me start creating these configurations:
```

### File Creation Sequence

**Action**: Created file `TradeConfirmationWorkflow.json` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/workflow-configurations`

**Action**: Created file `TradeWorkflow.json` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/workflow-configurations`

**Action**: Created file `PositionWorkflow.json` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/workflow-configurations`

**Action**: Created file `RegulatoryReportWorkflow.json` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/workflow-configurations`

**Action**: Created file `CounterpartyWorkflow.json` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/workflow-configurations`

**Action**: Created file `ProductWorkflow.json` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/workflow-configurations`

**Action**: Created file `AmendmentWorkflow.json` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/workflow-configurations`

**Response**:
```
Now let me create a summary document and validate the configurations:
```

**Action**: Created file `README.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/workflow-configurations`

**Response**:
```
Now let me validate one of the workflow configurations against the schema to ensure compliance:
```

### Validation Process

**Action**: Terminal
```bash
$ cd .ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/workflow-configurations && python3 -c "
import json
import jsonschema
import sys

# Load the schema
with open('../schema/common/statemachine/conf/WorkflowConfiguration.json', 'r') as f:
    schema = json.load(f)

# Load a sample workflow
with open('TradeConfirmationWorkflow.json', 'r') as f:
    workflow = json.load(f)

try:
    # Basic validation - check required fields
    required_fields = ['version', 'name', 'initialState', 'states']
    for field in required_fields:
        if field not in workflow:
            print(f'❌ Missing required field: {field}')
            sys.exit(1)

    # Check state naming convention
    for state_name in workflow['states'].keys():
        if not state_name[0].isalpha():
            print(f'❌ State name \"{state_name}\" does not start with a letter')
            sys.exit(1)
        if not all(c.isalnum() or c in '_-' for c in state_name):
            print(f'❌ State name \"{state_name}\" contains invalid characters')
            sys.exit(1)
    
    # Check that initialState exists in states
    if workflow['initialState'] not in workflow['states']:
        print(f'❌ Initial state \"{workflow[\"initialState\"]}\" not found in states')
        sys.exit(1)
    
    # Check criteria types
    def check_criteria(obj, path=''):
        if isinstance(obj, dict):
            if 'criterion' in obj:
                criterion = obj['criterion']
                if 'type' in criterion:
                    if criterion['type'] == 'simple':
                        print(f'⚠️  Found simple criterion at {path} - should use function or group')
                    elif criterion['type'] not in ['function', 'group']:
                        print(f'❌ Invalid criterion type \"{criterion[\"type\"]}\" at {path}')
                        sys.exit(1)
            for key, value in obj.items():
