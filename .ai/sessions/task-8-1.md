.
Let me check the system-specification directory first, as it likely contains the external interface specifications mentioned in the plan.
Read directory

Let me check the source directory structure to understand the codebase better.
Read directory
src
Let me explore the main source directory to understand the project structure and look for workflow configurations and event-related code.
Augment Context Engine
Find all workflow configuration JSON files, event-related classes, and external interface specifications in the codebase. I need to understand the complete event structure including external triggering events, internal workflow events, processor-generated events, and criteria evaluation events.
Now let me search for more specific information about event types and workflow configurations.
Augment Context Engine
Find all processor classes, criterion classes, and event handler classes that generate or handle events. Also find any event publishing, event subscription, or event routing code in the system.
Let me search for more information about error events, audit events, and system events.
Augment Context Engine
Find all error handling code, audit logging, system monitoring events, and any event publishing or event streaming mechanisms. Also look for any event correlation IDs, causation chains, or event metadata handling.
Now let me look for any existing event catalog or documentation structure.
Read directory
dtcc-reporting
.ai/tasks
Perfect! I can see there's already an events directory in the system-specification. Let me check what's already there.
Read directory

Based on my analysis of the codebase and existing documentation, I now have a comprehensive understanding of the event structure in the DTCC regulatory reporting system. Let me create a detailed plan for executing this task.
Plan for Creating Comprehensive Event Catalog and Specifications
Paul Muadib, I've analyzed the codebase and existing documentation to understand the complete event structure. Here's my detailed plan to create a comprehensive event catalog and specifications:
Files I need to create/modify:
Event Catalog Structure:
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events/event-catalog.md - Main event catalog index
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events/event-specifications/ - Directory for individual event specs
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events/event-template.md - Standardized event specification template
Event Category Documentation:
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events/business-events.md - Business event specifications
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events/system-events.md - System event specifications
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events/error-events.md - Error and audit event specifications
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events/external-events.md - External interface events
Event Processing Documentation:
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events/event-correlation-patterns.md - Correlation and causation chains
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events/event-routing-patterns.md - Event routing and subscription
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events/event-security-requirements.md - Security and access control
Detailed Analysis Results:
From my codebase analysis, I've identified these event categories:
External Triggering Events (from interface specifications):
FpML trade confirmation messages
DTCC GTR submission responses
GLEIF LEI validation responses
Reference data updates
External system health checks
Internal Workflow Events (from JSON configurations):
Entity state transition events
Processor execution events
Criteria evaluation events
Validation completion events
Error and retry events
System Events (from CloudEventType schema):
CalculationMemberJoinEvent, GreetEvent, KeepAliveEvent
EntityProcessorCalculationRequest/Response
EntityCriteriaCalculationRequest/Response
EntityModelImport/Export/Transition/Delete events
Entity CRUD operation events
Error and Audit Events:
Processing failure events
Escalation events
Audit trail events
Compliance monitoring events
The plan will create a searchable, comprehensive catalog with standardized specifications for each event type, including payload schemas, correlation patterns, and processing requirements.
Should I proceed with implementing this plan?

Yes

I'll proceed with implementing the comprehensive event catalog and specifications. Let me start by creating the standardized event specification template and then build out the complete catalog.
Edited file
8-1-Create-Comprehensive-Event-Catalog-and-Specifications.md
.ai/plans
Now let me create the standardized event specification template:
Created file
event-template.md
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events
Now let me create the main event catalog index:
Created file
event-catalog.md
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events
Now let me create the event specifications directory and start creating detailed specifications for key events:
Created file
business-events.md
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events
Now let me create the system events documentation:
Created file
system-events.md
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events
Now let me create the error and audit events documentation:
Created file
error-events.md
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events
Now let me create the external events documentation:
Created file
external-events.md
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events
Now let me create the event correlation patterns documentation:
Created file
event-correlation-patterns.md
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events
Now let me create the event routing and subscription patterns documentation:
Created file
event-routing-patterns.md
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events
Finally, let me create the event security requirements documentation:
Created file
event-security-requirements.md
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events
Now let me update the main event catalog to include references to all the detailed specifications I've created:
Edited file
event-catalog.md
.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events
Perfect! I have successfully completed the comprehensive event catalog and specifications for the DTCC Regulatory Reporting System. Let me provide a summary of what has been accomplished:
Summary of Completed Work
Paul Muadib, I have successfully executed the plan to create a comprehensive event catalog and specifications. Here's what has been delivered:
Core Documentation Created:
Event Template - Standardized specification template for all events
Event Catalog - Complete searchable index of all 89 event types
Business Events - 32 business events covering trade lifecycle, positions, regulatory compliance, and amendments
System Events - 25 system events for processing, integration, and entity management
Error and Audit Events - 18 events for error handling, monitoring, and compliance
External Interface Events - 14 events for DTCC GTR, GLEIF, trading systems, and monitoring
Event Correlation Patterns - Comprehensive correlation ID and causation chain documentation
Event Routing Patterns - Topic-based routing, subscription patterns, and load balancing
Event Security Requirements - Security classification, access control, and compliance requirements
Key Achievements:
