Now let me create a detailed plan for executing this task. Based on my analysis, I need to create comprehensive event documentation and swimlane diagrams for the DTCC regulatory reporting system.
Detailed Plan for Creating Event Documentation and Swimlane Diagrams
Paul Muadib, I have analyzed the current state of the project and the requirements for task 8. Here's my detailed plan:
Current State Analysis
External interface specifications are complete (task 7 dependency satisfied)
Some event documentation exists in .ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events/
Workflow configurations are complete with 58 processors and 47 criteria identified
Functional specifications are partially complete (36 out of 105 components)
Execution Plan
1. Compile Comprehensive Event Catalog
   Extract all incoming events from external interface specifications
   Document internal events from workflow transitions and processors
   Create event specifications with payload structures and metadata
2. Create Detailed Event Specifications
   Document event payload structures and schemas
   Define event metadata and correlation patterns
   Specify event timing and sequencing requirements
3. Design Swimlane Diagrams for Major Business Flows
   FpML trade confirmation processing flows
   Position building and reconciliation flows
   Regulatory reporting submission flows
   Counterparty data management flows
   Error handling and remediation flows
4. Document Entity Interactions and State Changes
   Show how events trigger entity state transitions
   Document data flow between entities
   Identify event correlation and causality relationships
5. Create Event Catalog with Cross-References
   Link events to workflows, entities, and processors
   Document event dependencies and relationships
   Validate against business requirements
   Deliverables
   Complete event catalog with 50+ event types
   Detailed event specifications with payload schemas
   5+ comprehensive swimlane diagrams
   Entity interaction documentation
   Event sequencing and timing requirements
   Cross-reference documentation linking events to system components
   Would you like me to proceed with executing this plan?
   06:33 AM
   Yes

I'll proceed with executing the plan for creating detailed event documentation and swimlane diagrams. Let me start by gathering comprehensive information about the current event documentation and then systematically build upon it.
Augment Context Engine
Find all existing event documentation, event flows, and event-related specifications in the DTCC reporting system. I need to understand what events are already documented, their structures, and what gaps exist in the event documentation.
Now let me examine the workflow configurations to extract all the events that are generated by processors and state transitions:
Augment Context Engine
Extract all event types, event names, and event flows from the workflow configuration JSON files. I need to understand what events are triggered by processors, state transitions, and criteria evaluations in all the workflow configurations.
Now let me create a comprehensive event catalog by analyzing all the information I've gathered. I'll start by creating the main event documentation structure:

Wait. One clarification

Paul Muadib, what clarification do you need regarding the event documentation and swimlane diagrams task?
06:37 AM
First produce a concise overview of the event catalog and the main external triggering events. I need to see if this is going in the right direction

I'll analyze the existing event documentation and create a concise overview of the event catalog and main external triggering events.

Now let me create a concise overview of the event catalog and main external triggering events:
Event Catalog Overview - DTCC Regulatory Reporting System
Main External Triggering Events
1. FpML Trade Confirmation Events
   Source: Trading Systems via REST API/Kafka
   Event: FpML_Trade_Confirmation_Received
   Frequency: Real-time, up to 10,000/hour
   Triggers: TradeConfirmation workflow → Trade creation → Position calculation
2. DTCC GTR Response Events
   Source: DTCC Global Trade Repository
   Events: DTCC_Acknowledgment_Received, DTCC_Rejection_Received
   Frequency: Asynchronous responses to submissions
   Triggers: Report status updates → Resubmission workflows
3. Counterparty Data Feed Events
   Source: LEI Registry (GLEIF), Data Providers
   Events: Counterparty_Data_Updated, LEI_Status_Changed
   Frequency: Daily batch + real-time critical updates
   Triggers: Counterparty validation → Trade reprocessing
4. Reference Data Feed Events
   Source: Market Data Providers
   Events: Reference_Data_Updated, Product_Data_Changed
   Frequency: Daily batch files
   Triggers: Product validation → Position recalculation
5. Scheduled System Events
   Source: Internal Scheduler
   Events: Daily_Reconciliation_Triggered, Reporting_Deadline_Approached
   Frequency: Time-based triggers
   Triggers: Batch processing → Reconciliation → Report generation
   Internal Event Categories
   Business Process Events (Generated by workflows)
   Trade lifecycle: Trade_Confirmed, Trade_Amended, Trade_Cancelled
   Position management: Position_Calculated, Position_Updated, Reconciliation_Required
   Reporting: Report_Generated, Report_Submitted, Report_Acknowledged
   System Events (Generated by processors)
   Validation: Validation_Passed, Validation_Failed, Business_Rules_Violated
   Processing: Processing_Complete, Processing_Failed, Retry_Required
   Error handling: Error_Escalated, Manual_Review_Required
   Event Flow Patterns
   Primary Flow: External Event → Validation → Business Processing → Position Update → Regulatory Reporting
   Error Flow: Validation Failure → Error Logging → Manual Review → Remediation
   Reconciliation Flow: Scheduled Trigger → Data Gathering → Comparison → Break Resolution
   Paul Muadib, does this overview align with your expectations for the event catalog direction? Should I proceed with creating detailed event specifications and comprehensive swimlane diagrams for each business flow?

   Decompose @8-Create-Detailed-Event-Documentation-and-Swimlane-Diagrams.md into sub-tasks using the @tasks.md rule. I will then ask to implement these sub-tasks.

I'll decompose the event documentation and swimlane diagrams task into sub-tasks following the rules in .augment/rules/tasks.md.

Understood. I propose the following tasks:
Create Comprehensive Event Catalog from External Interfaces
Extract and Document Internal Workflow Events
Create Detailed Event Specifications with Payload Schemas
Design FpML Trade Confirmation Processing Swimlane Diagrams
Design Position Building and Reconciliation Swimlane Diagrams
Design Regulatory Reporting Submission Swimlane Diagrams
Design Counterparty Data Management Swimlane Diagrams
Design Error Handling and Remediation Swimlane Diagrams
Document Event Sequencing and Timing Requirements
Create Event Correlation and Cross-Reference Documentation
Validate Event Flows Against Business Requirements
06:44 AM
I mean, divide @8-Create-Detailed-Event-Documentation-and-Swimlane-Diagrams.md into a set of sub-plans that logically decompose this such that each can be in separate sessions and form a self contained unit.

Understood. I propose the following tasks:
Create Comprehensive Event Catalog and Specifications
Design Trade Processing Swimlane Diagrams
Design Position Management and Reconciliation Swimlane Diagrams
Design Regulatory Reporting Swimlane Diagrams
Design Data Management and Error Handling Swimlane Diagrams
Create Event Correlation and Validation Documentation

Paul Muadib, I have successfully decomposed the event documentation and swimlane diagrams task into 6 self-contained sub-tasks:
Task-8-1.md - Create Comprehensive Event Catalog and Specifications
Task-8-2.md - Design Trade Processing Swimlane Diagrams
Task-8-3.md - Design Position Management and Reconciliation Swimlane Diagrams
Task-8-4.md - Design Regulatory Reporting Swimlane Diagrams
Task-8-5.md - Design Data Management and Error Handling Swimlane Diagrams
Task-8-6.md - Create Event Correlation and Validation Documentation
Each task is atomic and focused on a specific aspect of the event documentation, with clear dependencies and success criteria. Tasks 2-5 can be executed in parallel after Task 1 is complete, and Task 6 consolidates and validates the work from all previous tasks.

Rename the files to the pattern 8-<ID>-<TaskName>.md

I'll rename all the Task-8-* files to follow the 8--.md pattern.
