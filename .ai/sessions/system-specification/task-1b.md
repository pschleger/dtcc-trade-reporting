### Architecture Principles Reference Documentation Update

**Session Overview**
- **Date**: Follow-up session for Task 1 architecture principles enhancement
- **Objective**: Add reference document links to the Architecture Principles section

### 09:29 AM - Add Reference Document Links

**Command**: 
```
Add to the Architecture Principles, links to the two important reference documents @/.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/cyoda-design-principles.md and @/.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/workflow-config-guide.md upon which the system specification must be based.
```

**Alternative Command**: 
```
Add to the Architecture Principles, links to the two important reference documents @cyoda-design-principles.md and @workflow-config-guide.md upon which the system specification must be based.
```

**Response**:
```
Paul Muadib, I'll add the reference document links to the Architecture Principles section.
```

**Action**: Read directory `system-specification` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting`

**Response**:
```
I need to identify which file contains the Architecture Principles section to add the reference document links. Let me check the system architecture document:
```

**Action**: Read file `system-architecture.md` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification`

**Response**:
```
Perfect! I found the Architecture Principles section in the system-architecture.md file. Now I'll add the reference document links to establish the foundation documents that the system specification must be based upon.
```

**Action**: Edited file `system-architecture.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification`

### Update Summary

**Response**:
```
I have successfully added the reference document links to the Architecture Principles section. The update includes:

✅ Reference Documents Added:
- Link to cyoda-design-principles.md - Core Cyoda platform design principles
- Link to workflow-config-guide.md - Workflow configuration guidelines and best practices

✅ Foundation Established:
- Clear indication that these documents form the foundation for system specification
- Proper linking to ensure easy access to the reference materials
- Integration with existing Architecture Principles section

The Architecture Principles section now properly references the two critical foundation documents that guide the entire DTCC regulatory reporting system specification and implementation.
