## Detailed Plan for Creating Event Documentation and Swimlane Diagrams

Paul Muadib, I have analyzed the current state of the project and the requirements for task 8. Here's my detailed plan:

**Current State Analysis:**
- External interface specifications are complete (task 7 dependency satisfied)
- Some event documentation exists in .ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events/
- Workflow configurations are complete with 58 processors and 47 criteria identified
- Functional specifications are partially complete (36 out of 105 components)

**Execution Plan:**
1. Compile Comprehensive Event Catalog
   - Extract all incoming events from external interface specifications
   - Document internal events from workflow transitions and processors
   - Create event specifications with payload structures and metadata

2. Create Detailed Event Specifications
   - Document event payload structures and schemas
   - Define event metadata and correlation patterns
   - Specify event timing and sequencing requirements

3. Design Swimlane Diagrams for Major Business Flows
   - FpML trade confirmation processing flows
   - Position building and reconciliation flows
   - Regulatory reporting submission flows
   - Counterparty data management flows
   - Error handling and remediation flows

4. Document Entity Interactions and State Changes
   - Show how events trigger entity state transitions
   - Document data flow between entities
   - Identify event correlation and causality relationships

5. Create Event Catalog with Cross-References
   - Link events to workflows, entities, and processors
   - Document event dependencies and relationships
   - Validate against business requirements

**Deliverables:**
- Complete event catalog with 50+ event types
- Detailed event specifications with payload schemas
- 5+ comprehensive swimlane diagrams
- Entity interaction documentation
- Event sequencing and timing requirements
- Cross-reference documentation linking events to system components

Would you like me to proceed with executing this plan?

### 06:33 AM - Execution Confirmation

**User Input**:
```
Yes
```

**Response**:
```
I'll proceed with executing the plan for creating detailed event documentation and swimlane diagrams. Let me start by gathering comprehensive information about the current event documentation and then systematically build upon it.
```

**Action**: Augment Context Engine
```
Find all existing event documentation, event flows, and event-related specifications in the DTCC reporting system. I need to understand what events are already documented, their structures, and what gaps exist in the event documentation.
```

**Response**:
```
Now let me examine the workflow configurations to extract all the events that are generated by processors and state transitions:
```

**Action**: Augment Context Engine
```
Extract all event types, event names, and event flows from the workflow configuration JSON files. I need to understand what events are triggered by processors, state transitions, and criteria evaluations in all the workflow configurations.
```

**Response**:
```
Now let me create a comprehensive event catalog by analyzing all the information I've gathered. I'll start by creating the main event documentation structure:
```

### 06:34 AM - Clarification Request

```
First produce a concise overview of the event catalog and the main external triggering events. I need to see if this is going in the right direction
```

**Response**:
```
I'll analyze the existing event documentation and create a concise overview of the event catalog and main external triggering events.
```

**Action**: Read lines 1-50 `event-flows-position-reporting.md` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events`

**Action**: Read lines 20-80 `external-interface-specifications.md` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/external-interfaces`

**Action**: Terminal
```bash
$ find .ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/workflow-configurations -name "*.json" -exec grep -l "processors\|criterion" {} \;
```

**Action**: Read lines 1-50 `TradeConfirmationWorkflow.json` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/workflow-configurations`

### Event Catalog Overview

**Response**:
```
Now let me create a concise overview of the event catalog and main external triggering events:

## Event Catalog Overview - DTCC Regulatory Reporting System

**Main External Triggering Events:**

1. **FpML Trade Confirmation Events**
   - Source: Trading Systems via REST API/Kafka
   - Event: FpML_Trade_Confirmation_Received
   - Frequency: Real-time, up to 10,000/hour
   - Triggers: TradeConfirmation workflow → Trade creation → Position calculation

2. **DTCC GTR Response Events**
   - Source: DTCC Global Trade Repository
   - Events: DTCC_Acknowledgment_Received, DTCC_Rejection_Received
   - Frequency: Asynchronous responses to submissions
   - Triggers: Report status updates → Resubmission workflows

3. **Counterparty Data Feed Events**
   - Source: LEI Registry (GLEIF), Data Providers
   - Events: Counterparty_Data_Updated, LEI_Status_Changed
   - Frequency: Daily batch + real-time critical updates
   - Triggers: Counterparty validation → Trade reprocessing

4. **Reference Data Feed Events**
   - Source: Market Data Providers
   - Events: Reference_Data_Updated, Product_Data_Changed
   - Frequency: Daily batch files
   - Triggers: Product validation → Position recalculation

5. **Scheduled System Events**
   - Source: Internal Scheduler
   - Events: Daily_Reconciliation_Triggered, Reporting_Deadline_Approached
   - Frequency: Time-based triggers
   - Triggers: Batch processing → Reconciliation → Report generation

**Internal Event Categories:**

**Business Process Events (Generated by workflows):**
- Trade lifecycle: Trade_Confirmed, Trade_Amended, Trade_Cancelled
- Position management: Position_Calculated, Position_Updated, Reconciliation_Required
- Reporting: Report_Generated, Report_Submitted, Report_Acknowledged

**System Events (Generated by processors):**
- Validation: Validation_Passed, Validation_Failed, Business_Rules_Violated
- Processing: Processing_Complete, Processing_Failed, Retry_Required
- Error handling: Error_Escalated, Manual_Review_Required

**Event Flow Patterns:**
- Primary Flow: External Event → Validation → Business Processing → Position Update → Regulatory Reporting
- Error Flow: Validation Failure → Error Logging → Manual Review → Remediation
- Reconciliation Flow: Scheduled Trigger → Data Gathering → Comparison → Break Resolution

Paul Muadib, does this overview align with your expectations for the event catalog direction? Should I proceed with creating detailed event specifications and comprehensive swimlane diagrams for each business flow?

### 06:41 AM - Task Decomposition Request

**User Input**:
```
Decompose @8-Create-Detailed-Event-Documentation-and-Swimlane-Diagrams.md into sub-tasks using the @tasks.md rule. I will then ask to implement these sub-tasks.
```

**Response**:
```
I'll decompose the event documentation and swimlane diagrams task into sub-tasks following the rules in .augment/rules/tasks.md.
```

**Action**: Read rules file `tasks.md` from `.augment/rules`

**Action**: Read file `8-Create-Detailed-Event-Documentation-and-Swimlane-Diagrams.md` from `.ai/plans`

### Task Decomposition

**Response**:
```
Based on the task decomposition rules, I need to break down the comprehensive event documentation task into atomic, self-contained sub-tasks. Here's my proposed decomposition:

**Proposed Sub-Tasks:**

1. **Create Comprehensive Event Catalog and Specifications**
   - Extract and document all event types from external interfaces and workflows
   - Create detailed event specifications with payload schemas
   - Document event metadata and correlation patterns

2. **Design Trade Processing Swimlane Diagrams**
   - FpML trade confirmation processing flows
   - Trade amendment and cancellation workflows
   - Trade validation and error handling

3. **Design Position Management and Reconciliation Swimlane Diagrams**
   - Position calculation and aggregation flows
   - Daily reconciliation processes
   - Position break resolution workflows

4. **Design Regulatory Reporting Swimlane Diagrams**
   - DTCC GTR submission processes
   - Report generation and validation
   - Acknowledgment and rejection handling

5. **Design Data Management and Error Handling Swimlane Diagrams**

   - Reference data ingestion and validation
   - System-wide error handling and escalation

6. **Create Event Correlation and Validation Documentation**
   - Document event causality relationships
   - Create event timing and sequencing requirements
   - Validate event flows against business requirements

Each sub-task is atomic, has clear dependencies, and produces specific deliverables that can be executed independently in separate sessions.

Would you like me to create the individual plan files for these sub-tasks?
