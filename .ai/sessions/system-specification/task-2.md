# Agent Session Transcript - Task 2

## Threads

### 10:44 AM - Execute Business Use Cases Plan

**Command**: 
```
Execute the plan @/.ai/plans/2-Define-High-Level-Business-Use-Cases-and-Event-Flows.md
```

**Command**: 
```
Execute the plan @2-Define-High-Level-Business-Use-Cases-and-Event-Flows.md
```

**Response**:
```
I'll start by examining the plan file to understand what needs to be executed.
```

### File Reading and Analysis Phase

**Action**: Read file `2-Define-High-Level-Business-Use-Cases-and-Event-Flows.md` from `.ai/plans`

**Response**:
```
Now let me check the workspace structure to understand the current state and see if there are any existing documents or guidelines I should follow.
```

**Action**: Read directory `rules` from `.augment`

**Response**:
```
Let me check the tasks rule to understand how to approach this documentation task.
```

**Action**: Read rules file `tasks.md` from `.augment/rules`

**Response**:
```
Now let me check the existing project structure to understand what's already been done and what documentation exists.
```

**Action**: Read directory `.`

**Response**:
```
Let me check if there's already a system specification directory with relevant documentation.
```

**Action**: Read directory `system-specification`

**Response**:
```
Let me check if there are any existing plans or documentation from the previous task.
```

**Action**: Read directory `.ai`

**Response**:
```
Let me check if the first task has been completed to understand the dependencies.
```

**Action**: Read file `1-Create-High-Level-System-Architecture-and-Entity-Overview.md` from `.ai/plans`

**Response**:
```
Let me check if there are any existing documents from the first task completion.
```

**Action**: Augment Context Engine
```
Find any existing system architecture documentation, entity definitions, or business requirements documentation that might have been created for the DTCC reporting system
```

**Response**:
```
Perfect! I can see that the first task has been completed and there's comprehensive documentation already created. Now I need to execute the current plan to define high-level business use cases and event flows. Let me examine the existing documentation to understand the foundation and then create the business use cases.

Let me start by creating the business use cases documentation based on the plan requirements.
```

### File Creation Phase

**Action**: Created file `business-use-cases.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification`

**Response**:
```
Now I'll create the high-level event flow diagrams for the major use cases. Let me start with the primary trade processing flows.
```

**Action**: Created file `event-flows-trade-processing.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification`

**Response**:
```
Now I'll create the event flows for position management and regulatory reporting use cases.
```

**Action**: Created file `event-flows-position-reporting.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification`

**Response**:
```
Now I'll create the decision points and business rules documentation to complete the business use case analysis.
```

**Action**: Created file `decision-points-business-rules.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification`

**Response**:
```
Now I'll create the timing requirements and SLA documentation, followed by the use case relationship hierarchy to complete the plan.
```

**Action**: Created file `timing-requirements-slas.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification`

**Response**:
```
Now I'll create the final component - the use case relationship hierarchy.
```

**Action**: Created file `use-case-relationship-hierarchy.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification`

### Session Summary

**Response**:
```
Perfect! I have successfully executed the plan "Define High-Level Business Use Cases and Event Flows" by creating comprehensive documentation that covers all the requirements specified in the plan.
```

## Summary of Completed Work

**Response**:
```
I have created five comprehensive documents that fulfill all the success criteria from the plan:

1. Business Use Cases (business-use-cases.md)
   Complete catalog of 11 primary business use cases
   Detailed flows with preconditions, main flows, and success criteria
   Failure scenarios and timing requirements for each use case
   Use case dependencies and relationships

2. Event Flow Diagrams (event-flows-trade-processing.md and event-flows-position-reporting.md)
   High-level sequence diagrams using Mermaid notation
   Detailed event sequences for each major use case
   Decision points and branching logic
   Cross-use case event interactions and timing dependencies

3. Decision Points and Business Rules (decision-points-business-rules.md)
   12 critical decision points across all business processes
   48 specific business rules governing system behavior
   Rule categories and priority hierarchy
   Decision point dependencies and success metrics

4. Timing Requirements and SLAs (timing-requirements-slas.md)
   Regulatory deadlines and submission windows
   Performance targets for all use cases
   System availability and throughput requirements
   Business continuity and disaster recovery SLAs

5. Use Case Relationship Hierarchy (use-case-relationship-hierarchy.md)
   Hierarchical structure of use cases
   Sequential, conditional, and parallel dependencies
   Implementation priorities and phases
   Risk mitigation strategies
```

## Key Achievements

**Response**:
```
✅ Complete catalog of primary business use cases - 11 detailed use cases covering trade processing, position management, regulatory reporting, reference data management, and exception handling

✅ High-level event flow diagrams for each use case - Comprehensive sequence diagrams and event flows with decision points

✅ End-to-end process flow from FpML ingestion to DTCC reporting - Complete traceability from trade confirmation through regulatory submission

✅ Documented decision points and business rules - 12 decision points with 48 business rules ensuring regulatory compliance and operational efficiency

✅ Success and failure scenario definitions - Detailed success criteria and failure handling for each use case

✅ Timing and SLA requirements identified - Comprehensive performance targets aligned with regulatory deadlines

✅ Use case relationship hierarchy established - Clear dependencies and implementation priorities

This documentation provides the foundation for the next phase of detailed workflow design and system implementation. The business use cases and event flows will directly inform the workflow state machine designs and detailed functional specifications in subsequent tasks.
