### 04:51 PM - Consolidation Task

**User Input**:
```
We need to consolidate the documentation that has been created in sessions to execute the plans in @plans .

There are artefacts in diverse locations
@deliverables
@functional-specifications
@workflow-configurations

These must all be consolidated into the correct directory @system-specification

They must be sorted into the various directories that have been prepared.
```

### Analysis and Planning Phase

**Response**:
```
Paul Muadib, I'll help you consolidate the documentation from various locations into the correct directory structure. Let me first examine the current state of the directories and files to understand what needs to be moved.
```

**Action**: Read directory `plans` from `.ai`

**Action**: Read directory `deliverables` from `.ai`

**Action**: Read directory `functional-specifications` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting`

**Action**: Read directory `workflow-configurations` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting`

**Action**: Read directory `system-specification` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting`

**Response**:
```
Now let me check what directories are available in the system-specification folder to understand the target structure:
```

**Action**: Read directory `system-specification` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting`

### Consolidation Planning

**Response**:
```
Based on my analysis, I can see the target directory structure in .ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification has the following main directories:
- architecture/
- business/
- entities/
- events/
- requirements/
- standards/
- workflows/

Now let me create a detailed plan for consolidating the documentation:

## Consolidation Plan

I need to move and organize files from three source locations into the correct target directories:

**From .ai/deliverables/:**
- Swimlane diagrams → system-specification/events/ (since they show event flows)
- Mermaid diagram files → system-specification/events/ or system-specification/workflows/ depending on content

**From .ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/functional-specifications/:**
- Component specifications → system-specification/workflows/ (as they define workflow components)
- Performance requirements → system-specification/requirements/
- Validation reports → system-specification/requirements/ or keep as reference

**From .ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/workflow-configurations/:**
- JSON workflow files → system-specification/workflows/
- README and validation reports → system-specification/workflows/

Let me start by examining some key files to understand their content and determine the best placement:
```

**Action**: Read lines 1-20 `trade-processing-swimlane-diagrams.md` from `.ai/deliverables`

**Action**: Read lines 1-20 `performance-requirements.md` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/functional-specifications`

**Action**: Read lines 1-20 `README.md` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/workflow-configurations`

### File Movement Phase

**Response**:
```
Now let me proceed with the consolidation. I'll start by moving files systematically:

## Step 1: Move swimlane diagrams from deliverables to events directory

```

**Response**:
```
## Step 8: Verify the final structure
```

**Action**: Read directory `system-specification` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting`

### Consolidation Summary

**Response**:
```
Perfect! The consolidation is complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Consolidation Summary

All documentation has been successfully consolidated into `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/` with the following organization:

### Events Directory (events/)
✅ trade-processing-swimlane-diagrams.md
✅ regulatory-reporting-swimlane-diagrams.md
✅ position-management-reconciliation-swimlane-diagrams.md
✅ diagrams/ folder with Mermaid files:
- dtcc-acknowledgment-handling-swimlane.mmd
- dtcc-submission-process-swimlane.mmd
- regulatory-report-generation-swimlane.mmd

### Requirements Directory (requirements/)
✅ performance-requirements.md (moved from functional-specifications)
✅ validation-reports/ folder with business requirement alignment

### Workflows Directory (workflows/)
✅ All JSON workflow configurations:
- AmendmentWorkflow.json
- CancellationWorkflow.json
- CounterpartyWorkflow.json
- PositionWorkflow.json
- ProcessingBatchWorkflow.json
- ProductWorkflow.json
- ReconciliationResultWorkflow.json
- RegulatoryReportWorkflow.json
- TradeConfirmationWorkflow.json
- TradeWorkflow.json
✅ workflow-configurations-readme.md
✅ VALIDATION_REPORT.md

### New Functional Specifications Directory (functional-specifications/)
✅ criteria/ folder with all criteria specifications
✅ processors/ folder with all processor specifications
✅ component-interaction-diagrams.md
✅ specification-template.md
✅ README.md
✅ CURRENT_STATUS.md
✅ generate_remaining_specs.py

### Cleanup Completed
✅ Removed empty directories:
- .ai/deliverables/
- .ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/functional-specifications/
- .ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/workflow-configurations/

The system specification directory now contains all the documentation artifacts in a well-organized structure that aligns with the directory hierarchy that was already established. All files have been preserved and are now accessible from their appropriate locations within the consolidated system specification.
```

### Workflow Configuration Clarification

**User Input**:
```
workflow configurations are placed in @workflow
```

**Interface Note**: Drop files to attach as context - images (png, jpg, jpeg)
