### Codebase Analysis Phase

**Response**:
```
Now I need to gather information about the regulatory reporting system to understand the context for creating these swimlane diagrams. Let me search for information about regulatory reporting in the codebase.
```

**Action**: Augment Context Engine
```
Find information about regulatory reporting system, including RegulatoryReport, SubmissionStatus, ReportingObligation entities, DTCC GTR submission processes, report generation workflows, validation processes, and compliance monitoring. I need to understand the complete regulatory reporting lifecycle to create comprehensive swimlane diagrams.
```

**Response**:
```
Let me search for more specific information about DTCC submission processes and error handling:
```

**Action**: Augment Context Engine
```
Find information about DTCC GTR submission acknowledgment processing, rejection handling, error remediation workflows, resubmission procedures, deadline monitoring, compliance tracking, audit trail requirements, and manual review processes for regulatory reports.
```

**Response**:
```
Now let me check for information about deadline monitoring and compliance tracking:
```

**Action**: Augment Context Engine
```
Find information about regulatory deadline monitoring, compliance obligation tracking, audit trail requirements, manual review workflows, alerting systems, and performance monitoring for regulatory reporting. I need details about timing requirements, SLA monitoring, and escalation procedures.
```

### Blueprint Presentation Phase

**Response**:
```
Based on my analysis of the regulatory reporting system, I now have comprehensive information to create the swimlane diagrams. Following the task decomposition rules, I need to present a blueprint first.

Paul Muadib, I will develop a blueprint to address your goal of designing comprehensive regulatory reporting swimlane diagrams. Here are the proposed Actionable Steps:

1. Design Automated Report Generation Swimlane Diagram
2. Design Report Validation and Compliance Checking Swimlane Diagram
3. Design DTCC GTR Submission Process Swimlane Diagram
4. Design DTCC Acknowledgment and Rejection Handling Swimlane Diagram
5. Design Report Resubmission and Correction Procedures Swimlane Diagram
6. Design Regulatory Deadline Monitoring and Alert Flows Swimlane Diagram
7. Design Compliance Obligation Tracking Swimlane Diagram
8. Design Audit Trail and Record Keeping Swimlane Diagram
9. Design Error Handling for Submission Failures Swimlane Diagram
10. Validate Diagrams Against Regulatory Reporting Use Cases
```

### 03:02 PM - Blueprint Approval

**User Input**: 
```
proceed
```

**Response**:
```
Paul Muadib, blueprint confirmed. In which directory should I place the plan files? They will be named using the format <number>-<TaskName>.md (e.g., 1-Design-Automated-Report-Generation-Swimlane-Diagram.md).
```

### 03:04 PM - Direct Execution Instruction

**User Input**: 
```
No, you don't need to produce the plan files. You already have the plan file. You can execute it. It was created before the rule @tasks.md was updated to its latest version
```

### Implementation Phase

**Response**:
```
Paul Muadib, I understand. I'll execute the existing plan directly. Let me start by creating the comprehensive swimlane diagrams for the regulatory reporting system.

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I'll create swimlane diagrams that show the complete regulatory reporting lifecycle from report generation through DTCC GTR submission, acknowledgment processing, and error remediation.
```

**Action**: Created file `regulatory-reporting-swimlane-diagrams.md` in `.ai/deliverables`

**Response**:
```
Now I'll continue adding the remaining swimlane diagrams to the file:
```

**Action**: Edited file `regulatory-reporting-swimlane-diagrams.md` in `.ai/deliverables`

**Response**:
```
Now I'll add the remaining swimlane diagrams:
```

**Action**: Edited file `regulatory-reporting-swimlane-diagrams.md` in `.ai/deliverables`

**Response**:
```
Now I'll add the final swimlane diagrams:
```

**Action**: Edited file `regulatory-reporting-swimlane-diagrams.md` in `.ai/deliverables`

**Response**:
```
Now I'll add the final section with validation and summary:
```

**Action**: Edited file `regulatory-reporting-swimlane-diagrams.md` in `.ai/deliverables`

### Diagram File Creation Phase

**Response**:
```
Now let me create individual Mermaid diagram files for better visualization and reusability:
```

**Action**: Created file `regulatory-report-generation-swimlane.mmd` in `.ai/deliverables/diagrams`

**Action**: Created file `dtcc-submission-process-swimlane.mmd` in `.ai/deliverables/diagrams`

**Action**: Created file `dtcc-acknowledgment-handling-swimlane.mmd` in `.ai/deliverables/diagrams`

### Diagram Validation Phase

**Response**:
```
Now let me render one of the key diagrams to demonstrate the visual output:
```

**Action**: Render Mermaid

**DTCC GTR Submission Process Swimlane**
