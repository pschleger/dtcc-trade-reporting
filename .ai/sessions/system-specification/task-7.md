Plan for Executing Task 7: Define Detailed External Interface Specifications

Paul Muadib, I have analyzed the codebase and understand the DTCC reporting system architecture. Based on the plan and the existing functional specifications, I will now execute the task to define detailed external interface specifications.

Detailed Plan:
- Create comprehensive external interface documentation covering all 8 identified external interface categories
- Document technical protocols, data formats, and security requirements for each interface
- Define error handling, retry mechanisms, and SLA requirements
- Create interface interaction diagrams showing data flow patterns
- Specify authentication, authorization, and monitoring requirements

Files to create:
- External interface specifications document with technical details for each interface
- Interface interaction diagrams using Mermaid
- Security and authentication requirements specification
- Error handling and monitoring specifications

Let me start by creating the main external interface specifications document:
```

**Action**: Edited file `7-Define-Detailed-External-Interface-Specifications.md` in `.ai/plans`

### Implementation Phase

**Response**:
```
Now I'll create the comprehensive external interface specifications document:
```

**Action**: Created file `external-interface-specifications.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/external-interfaces`

**Response**:
```
Now I'll create the interface interaction diagrams to visualize the data flow patterns:
```

**Action**: Created file `interface-interaction-diagrams.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/external-interfaces`

**Response**:
```
Let me continue with the interface interaction diagrams:
```

**Action**: Edited file `interface-interaction-diagrams.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/external-interfaces`

**Response**:
```
Let me check the current content of the file and continue adding the diagrams:
```

**Action**: Read file `interface-interaction-diagrams.md` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/external-interfaces`

**Response**:
```
I see the file was truncated. Let me recreate it properly:
```

**Action**: Edited file `interface-interaction-diagrams.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/external-interfaces`

**Response**:
```
Let me fix the file content:
```

**Action**: Edited file `interface-interaction-diagrams.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/external-interfaces`

**Response**:
```
Let me remove the file and recreate it properly:
```

**Action**: Remove `interface-interaction-diagrams.md` from `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/external-interfaces`

**Action**: Created file `interface-interaction-diagrams.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/external-interfaces`

### Diagram Rendering Phase

**Response**:
```
Now let me render the first diagram to visualize the high-level architecture:
```

**Action**: Render Mermaid

**High-Level External Interface Architecture**

### Additional Documentation Phase

**Response**:
```
Now let me create a security and compliance requirements document:
```

**Action**: Created file `security-and-compliance-requirements.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/external-interfaces`

**Response**:
```
Finally, let me create an integration testing guide:
```

**Action**: Created file `integration-testing-guide.md` in `.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/external-interfaces`
