# Actionable Step: Implement Workflow Processor Components

**Objective:** Develop all workflow processor components that execute business logic, data transformations, and entity state changes within the Cyoda EDBMS framework.

**Prerequisites:** Actionable Step 2 must be completed (Workflow Criteria Components).

4. Implement regulatory reporting processors for DTCC GTR submission preparation
5. Create counterparty management processors for LEI validation and entity updates
6. Develop reference data management processors for market data integration
7. Implement reconciliation processors for trade and position matching
8. Create error handling processors for exception management and recovery
9. Develop batch processing processors for high-volume data operations
10. Implement amendment processing processors for trade modification workflows
11. Create cancellation processing processors for trade termination handling
12. Develop audit and compliance processors for regulatory trail maintenance
13. Implement notification processors for alerts and status updates
14. Create data enrichment processors for external reference data integration
15. Develop performance monitoring processors for SLA tracking
16. Write unit tests using test-driven development for all processor components
17. Implement processor orchestration and dependency management
