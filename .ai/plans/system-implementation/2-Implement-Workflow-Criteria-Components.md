# Actionable Step: Implement Workflow Criteria Components

**Objective:** Develop all workflow criteria components that evaluate business rules, data quality, validation, and processing conditions within the Cyoda EDBMS framework.

**Prerequisites:** Actionable Step 1 must be completed (External Interface Integrations for Incoming Data).

- **[Data Quality Criteria](../../docs/content/System-Specification/functional-specifications/criteria/data-quality-criteria/)** - Data completeness and consistency validation
- **[Error Detection Criteria](../../docs/content/System-Specification/functional-specifications/criteria/error-detection-criteria/)** - Processing anomaly identification
- **[Processing Status Criteria](../../docs/content/System-Specification/functional-specifications/criteria/processing-status-criteria/)** - Workflow state management
- **[Regulatory Compliance Criteria](../../docs/content/System-Specification/functional-specifications/criteria/regulatory-compliance-criteria/)** - DTCC GTR compliance rules
- **[Validation Criteria](../../docs/content/System-Specification/functional-specifications/criteria/validation-criteria/)** - Schema and business rule enforcement
- **[Workflow Control Criteria](../../docs/content/System-Specification/functional-specifications/criteria/workflow-control-criteria/)** - Routing and decision logic

### Architecture and Design
- **[Entity-Driven Architecture](../../docs/content/System-Specification/architecture/entity-driven-architecture.md)** - Cyoda EDBMS architectural principles
- **[Workflow State Machines](../../docs/content/System-Specification/workflows/workflow-state-machines.md)** - State transition specifications
- **[Business Use Cases](../../docs/content/System-Specification/business/business-use-cases.md)** - Business context for criteria logic
- **[Decision Points Business Rules](../../docs/content/System-Specification/business/decision-points-business-rules.md)** - Business rule specifications

**Action Items:**
1. Implement business logic criteria for trade validation and regulatory compliance checks
2. Create data quality criteria for FpML data completeness and consistency validation
3. Develop error detection criteria for identifying processing anomalies and data issues
4. Implement processing status criteria for workflow state management and transitions
5. Create regulatory compliance criteria for DTCC GTR reporting requirements
6. Develop validation criteria for entity schema compliance and business rule enforcement
7. Implement workflow control criteria for routing and decision-making logic
8. Create counterparty validation criteria for LEI verification and entity checks
9. Implement position calculation criteria for derivatives position management
10. Develop timing and SLA criteria for regulatory reporting deadlines
11. Create amendment and cancellation criteria for trade lifecycle management
12. Implement reconciliation criteria for position and trade matching
13. Add error handling and fallback logic for criteria evaluation failures
14. Create criteria configuration management for business rule updates
15. Write unit tests using test-driven development for all criteria components
16. Implement criteria performance optimization for high-volume processing
17. Add logging and monitoring for criteria evaluation results and performance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All criteria components integrate properly with Cyoda EDBMS workflow engine
- Business rules are correctly implemented and validated against specifications
- Data quality checks identify and flag incomplete or inconsistent data
- Regulatory compliance criteria enforce DTCC GTR requirements accurately
- Workflow control criteria route entities through proper processing paths
- Error detection and handling work correctly for all failure scenarios
- Unit test coverage exceeds 90% for all criteria components
- Performance meets SLA requirements for high-volume trade processing
- Configuration management allows dynamic business rule updates
- Logging provides detailed audit trail of all criteria evaluations
