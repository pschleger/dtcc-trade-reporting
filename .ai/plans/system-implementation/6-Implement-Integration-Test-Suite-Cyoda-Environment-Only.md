# Actionable Step: Implement Integration Test Suite (Cyoda Environment Only)

**Objective:** Develop integration tests that validate system components working together within the Cyoda EDBMS test environment, focusing on entity persistence, workflow execution, and data consistency.

**Prerequisites:** Actionable Step 5 must be completed (Test Data Generators and Mock Services).

**Action Items:**
1. Set up Cyoda test environment configuration and connection management
2. Create integration test base classes with Cyoda EDBMS test utilities
3. Implement entity persistence integration tests for all business entities
4. Develop workflow execution integration tests for complete processing flows
5. Create criteria evaluation integration tests within Cyoda workflow engine
6. Implement processor execution integration tests for data transformations
7. Develop entity state transition integration tests for lifecycle management
8. Create data consistency integration tests across related entities
9. Implement transaction management integration tests for rollback scenarios
10. Develop performance integration tests for high-volume entity processing
11. Create concurrent processing integration tests for parallel workflows
12. Implement error handling integration tests for exception scenarios
13. Develop audit trail integration tests for compliance tracking
14. Create schema validation integration tests for entity compliance
15. Implement query and retrieval integration tests for data access patterns
16. Develop workflow dependency integration tests for complex orchestration
17. Create test data setup and teardown utilities for test isolation
18. Implement integration test reporting and metrics collection
19. Develop continuous integration pipeline integration for automated testing
20. Create integration test documentation and troubleshooting guides

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All integration tests run successfully against Cyoda test environment
- Entity persistence tests validate proper storage and retrieval of all business entities
- Workflow execution tests confirm complete processing flows work end-to-end
- Criteria and processor integration tests validate proper Cyoda EDBMS integration
- Transaction management tests ensure data consistency and proper rollback behavior
- Performance tests validate system meets SLA requirements under load
- Error handling tests confirm proper exception management and recovery
- Test isolation ensures tests can run independently without interference
- Integration test suite provides comprehensive coverage of system interactions
- Automated test execution integrates with continuous integration pipeline
