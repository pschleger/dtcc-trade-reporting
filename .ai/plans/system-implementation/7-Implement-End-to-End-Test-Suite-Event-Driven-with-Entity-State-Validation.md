# Actionable Step: Implement End-to-End Test Suite (Event-Driven with Entity State Validation)

**Objective:** Develop end-to-end tests that use test generators to push events to the system as a Cyoda client, then validate proper entity states, content, and outgoing events/messages to ensure complete workflow functionality.

**Prerequisites:** Actionable Step 6 must be completed (Integration Test Suite - Cyoda Environment Only).

**Action Items:**
1. Create end-to-end test framework with Cyoda client connectivity
2. Implement event injection utilities for pushing test events to the system
3. Develop entity state validation utilities for verifying processing outcomes
4. Create outgoing event/message capture and validation mechanisms
5. Implement complete trade lifecycle end-to-end tests (new, amend, cancel)
6. Develop regulatory reporting end-to-end tests with DTCC GTR mock validation
7. Create position management end-to-end tests for derivatives calculations
8. Implement error handling end-to-end tests for exception scenarios
9. Develop batch processing end-to-end tests for high-volume scenarios
10. Create reconciliation end-to-end tests for trade and position matching
11. Implement timing and SLA end-to-end tests for regulatory deadlines
12. Develop counterparty management end-to-end tests with LEI validation
13. Create audit trail end-to-end tests for compliance verification
14. Implement concurrent processing end-to-end tests for parallel workflows
15. Develop data quality end-to-end tests for validation and error detection
16. Create performance end-to-end tests for system load and stress testing
17. Implement end-to-end test orchestration and scenario management
18. Develop test result analysis and reporting utilities
19. Create end-to-end test data correlation and traceability mechanisms
20. Implement automated end-to-end test execution and CI/CD integration

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- End-to-end tests successfully connect to Cyoda as a client and inject events
- Entity state validation confirms proper processing and data transformations
- Outgoing event/message validation ensures correct external system interactions
- Complete trade lifecycle tests validate all workflow paths and state transitions
- Regulatory reporting tests confirm compliant DTCC GTR submission generation
- Error handling tests validate proper exception management and recovery
- Performance tests confirm system meets SLA requirements under realistic load
- Concurrent processing tests validate system stability under parallel execution
- Test orchestration allows complex scenario execution and result correlation
- Automated execution integrates with CI/CD pipeline for continuous validation
