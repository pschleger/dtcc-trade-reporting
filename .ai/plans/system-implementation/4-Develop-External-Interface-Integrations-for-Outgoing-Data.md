# Actionable Step: Develop External Interface Integrations for Outgoing Data

**Objective:** Implement Spring Boot components for sending regulatory reports, notifications, and data to external systems including DTCC GTR, LEI registry, and monitoring platforms.

**Prerequisites:** Actionable Step 3 must be completed (Workflow Processor Components).

**Action Items:**
1. Implement DTCC GTR submission client for regulatory report transmission
2. Create LEI registry integration client for entity identifier validation
3. Develop notification service clients for alerts and status updates
4. Implement audit system integration for compliance trail transmission
5. Create market data service clients for reference data updates
6. Develop error notification clients for exception alerting
7. Implement file export services for batch regulatory submissions
8. Create webhook clients for real-time event notifications
9. Develop email and SMS notification services for critical alerts
10. Implement secure file transfer clients (SFTP/FTPS) for data exchange
11. Create REST client configurations with retry logic and circuit breakers
12. Develop message queue producers for asynchronous outbound messaging
13. Implement authentication and certificate management for external systems
14. Create response handling and acknowledgment processing
15. Develop outbound data transformation and formatting services
16. Write unit tests using test-driven development for all outbound integrations
17. Implement connection pooling and resource management
18. Add comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
19. Create outbound message tracking and delivery confirmation
20. Implement rate limiting and throttling for external API calls

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- DTCC GTR submissions are transmitted successfully with proper formatting
- LEI registry validations work correctly with appropriate error handling
- Notification services deliver alerts reliably to configured recipients
- Audit system integration maintains complete compliance trails
- All outbound integrations handle authentication and security properly
- Error handling and retry mechanisms work for all failure scenarios
- Unit test coverage exceeds 90% for all outbound integration components
- Connection pooling optimizes resource usage and performance
- Rate limiting prevents external system overload
- Message tracking provides complete delivery audit trail
