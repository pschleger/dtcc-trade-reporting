# Task: Design Data Management and Error Handling Swimlane Diagrams

**Problem:** Create detailed swimlane diagrams showing counterparty data management, reference data processing, product lifecycle management, and comprehensive error handling and remediation flows across all system components.

**Dependencies:** Task-8-1

**Plan:**
1. Analyze counterparty, product, and reference data management workflows
2. Identify all entities involved in data management (Counterparty, Product, ReferenceData, LegalEntity)
3. Design swimlane diagram for counterparty onboarding and LEI validation
4. Document counterparty data updates and synchronization with external sources
5. Design swimlane diagram for product lifecycle management and approval processes
6. Show reference data ingestion, validation, and distribution flows
7. Document data quality monitoring and anomaly detection processes
8. Design comprehensive error handling swimlane diagram for system-wide failures
9. Show error escalation procedures and manual intervention workflows
10. Document retry mechanisms and circuit breaker patterns
11. Include batch processing error handling and recovery procedures
12. Show data remediation and correction workflows
13. Document monitoring and alerting for data quality issues
14. Include audit logging and compliance tracking for data changes
15. Validate diagrams against data management and error handling use cases
