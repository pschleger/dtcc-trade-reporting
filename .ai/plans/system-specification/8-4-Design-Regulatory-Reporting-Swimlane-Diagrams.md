# Task: Design Regulatory Reporting Swimlane Diagrams

**Problem:** Create comprehensive swimlane diagrams showing the complete regulatory reporting lifecycle from report generation through DTCC GTR submission, acknowledgment processing, and error remediation, including all compliance monitoring and audit requirements.

**Dependencies:** Task-8-1

**Plan:**
1. Analyze regulatory reporting workflows and DTCC GTR submission processes
2. Identify all entities involved in reporting (RegulatoryReport, SubmissionStatus, ReportingObligation)
3. Design swimlane diagram for automated report generation triggered by thresholds
4. Document report validation and business rule compliance checking flows
5. Design swimlane diagram for DTCC GTR submission process
6. Show DTCC acknowledgment and rejection handling flows
7. Document report resubmission and correction procedures
8. Design swimlane diagram for regulatory deadline monitoring and alerts
9. Show compliance obligation tracking and fulfillment verification
10. Document audit trail creation and regulatory record keeping
11. Include timing requirements and regulatory deadline constraints
12. Show error handling for submission failures and network issues
13. Document manual review and approval workflows for complex reports
14. Include monitoring and alerting for submission status tracking
15. Validate diagrams against regulatory reporting use cases and compliance requirements
