# Task: Create Comprehensive Event Catalog and Specifications

**Problem:** Create a complete catalog of all events in the DTCC regulatory reporting system, including external triggering events and internal workflow events, with detailed specifications for each event type including payload structures, metadata, and processing requirements.

**Dependencies:** 7-Define-Detailed-External-Interface-Specifications

**Plan:**
1. Analyze all external interface specifications to extract incoming event types
2. Extract all internal events from workflow configuration JSON files
3. Identify events generated by processors during state transitions
4. Document events triggered by criteria evaluations and business rule violations
5. Create standardized event specification template with required fields
6. Document each event type with payload structure, metadata, and context
7. Define event versioning and schema evolution requirements
8. Specify event correlation patterns using correlation IDs and causation chains
9. Document event persistence and retention requirements
10. Create event routing and subscription patterns
11. Define event security and access control requirements
12. Organize events into logical categories (business, system, error, audit)
13. Create comprehensive event catalog with searchable index
14. Document event publishing and consumption patterns
15. Validate event catalog completeness against all system components

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Complete list of all external triggering events from interface specifications
- [x] Complete list of all internal events from workflow configurations
- [x] Standardized event specification template created
