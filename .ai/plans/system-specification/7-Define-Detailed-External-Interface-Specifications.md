# Task: Define Detailed External Interface Specifications

**Problem:** Document all external interfaces required for the DTCC reporting system, including technical protocols, data formats, and functional requirements for integration with external systems and regulatory bodies.

**Dependencies:** 6-Develop-Detailed-Functional-Specifications-for-Workflow-Components

**Plan:**
1. Identify all external systems that interface with the DTCC reporting system
2. Define FpML trade confirmation message ingestion interface specifications
3. Define DTCC GTR regulatory reporting submission interface specifications
4. Define counterparty static data feed interface specifications
5. Define reference data feed interface specifications (instruments, currencies, etc.)
6. Define market data feed interface specifications (if required for reporting)
7. Define audit and monitoring interface specifications
8. Define error notification and alerting interface specifications
9. Document technical protocols (REST, messaging, file transfer, etc.) for each interface
10. Specify data formats, schemas, and validation requirements
11. Define authentication, authorization, and security requirements
12. Document error handling and retry mechanisms for each interface
13. Specify SLA requirements and monitoring capabilities
14. Create interface interaction diagrams showing data flow patterns

**Success Criteria:**
- [x] Complete list of external interfaces with descriptions
- [x] Technical specifications for each interface (protocol, format, security)
- [x] Functional specifications for each interface (purpose, data flow, business rules)
- [x] Error handling and retry mechanisms documented
- [x] SLA requirements and monitoring specifications defined
- [x] Interface interaction diagrams created
- [x] Security and authentication requirements specified
- [x] Integration testing considerations documented
