# Task: Assemble Complete System Specification with Navigation

**Problem:** Create a comprehensive system specification document that integrates all the detailed artifacts produced in previous tasks, providing clear navigation and cross-references to enable stakeholders to understand and use the complete DTCC reporting system specification.

All artefacts are located in the specification/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/ directory.
Place the docs in the specification/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/ directory.


**Dependencies:** 8-Create-Detailed-Event-Documentation-and-Swimlane-Diagrams

**Plan:**
1. Create a master specification document with executive summary and system overview
2. Integrate the high-level architecture and entity overview from Task 1
3. Integrate the business use cases and event flows from Task 2
4. Integrate the workflow state machine designs from Task 3
5. Create an index of all entity schemas with descriptions and cross-references
6. Create an index of all workflow configurations with descriptions and cross-references
7. Create an index of all functional specifications with cross-references to workflows
8. Create an index of all external interfaces with integration guidance
9. Create an index of all events and swimlane diagrams with cross-references
10. Add navigation links between related sections and artifacts
11. Create a glossary of terms and acronyms used throughout the specification
12. Add appendices with technical details and implementation guidance
13. Create a document structure that supports both linear reading and reference lookup
14. Validate completeness and consistency across all integrated artifacts

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Master specification document with clear structure and navigation
- [ ] All artifacts from previous tasks integrated with proper cross-references
- [ ] Index pages for entities, workflows, components, interfaces, and events
- [ ] Navigation links between related sections working correctly
- [ ] Glossary of terms and acronyms included
- [ ] Document supports both linear reading and reference lookup
- [ ] Completeness validation completed across all artifacts
- [ ] Consistency check completed for terminology and references
