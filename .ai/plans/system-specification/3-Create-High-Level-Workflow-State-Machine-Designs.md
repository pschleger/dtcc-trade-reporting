# Task: Create High-Level Workflow State Machine Designs

**Problem:** Design the conceptual state machines that will govern entity lifecycles in the DTCC reporting system, establishing the foundation for detailed Cyoda workflow configurations that comply with the [WorkflowConfiguration.json](../.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/schema/common/statemachine/conf/WorkflowConfiguration.json) schema, while ensuring all business scenarios are properly modeled.

**Dependencies:** 2-Define-High-Level-Business-Use-Cases-and-Event-Flows

**Plan:**
1. Analyze each core entity identified in Task 1 to determine which require workflow management
2. Design high-level state machines for trade confirmation processing
3. Design high-level state machines for position management and reconciliation
4. Design high-level state machines for counterparty data lifecycle
5. Design high-level state machines for regulatory reporting submission
6. Design high-level state machines for error handling and remediation
7. Create state transition diagrams showing major states and transitions
8. Define the relationship between different entity workflows
9. Identify cross-workflow dependencies and coordination points
10. Document manual vs automated transition patterns
11. Define terminal states and completion criteria for each workflow
12. Create a workflow interaction diagram showing how different state machines coordinate
13. Ensure designs align with Cyoda [WorkflowConfiguration.json](../../specification/dtcc-reporting/schema/common/statemachine/conf/WorkflowConfiguration.json) schema requirements
14. Validate that state names follow schema requirements (start with letter, alphanumeric/underscore/hyphen only)

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] State machine designs for all workflow-managed entities
- [ ] State transition diagrams for each workflow
- [ ] Clear definition of manual vs automated transitions
- [ ] Cross-workflow dependencies documented
- [ ] Terminal states and completion criteria defined
- [ ] Workflow interaction diagram created
- [ ] Designs comply with Cyoda [WorkflowConfiguration.json](../../specification/dtcc-reporting/schema/common/statemachine/conf/WorkflowConfiguration.json) schema structure
- [ ] State naming conventions follow schema requirements
- [ ] Validation that all use cases from Task 2 are supported by the workflows
