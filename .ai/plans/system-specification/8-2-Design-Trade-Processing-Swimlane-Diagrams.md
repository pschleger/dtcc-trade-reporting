# Task: Design Trade Processing Swimlane Diagrams

**Problem:** Create comprehensive swimlane diagrams showing the complete flow of trade processing events from FpML message ingestion through trade confirmation, validation, and conversion, including all entity interactions, decision points, and error handling paths.

**Dependencies:** Task-8-1

**Plan:**
1. Analyze existing trade processing event flows and workflow configurations
2. Identify all entities involved in trade processing (TradeConfirmation, Trade, Counterparty, Product)
3. Map the complete FpML message ingestion and validation flow
4. Design swimlane diagram for successful trade confirmation processing
5. Design swimlane diagram for trade validation failure scenarios
6. Document trade amendment processing flow with entity state changes
7. Document trade cancellation processing flow with position impacts
8. Show decision points and branching logic for business rule validation
9. Include timing requirements and SLA constraints in diagrams
10. Document error handling and retry mechanisms in separate swimlanes
11. Show external system interactions (trading systems, reference data)
12. Include audit trail creation and compliance logging flows
13. Document parallel processing paths and synchronization points
14. Add detailed annotations for each processing step and decision point
15. Validate diagrams against trade processing use cases and requirements

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Swimlane diagram for FpML message ingestion and validation flow
- [ ] Swimlane diagram for successful trade confirmation processing
- [ ] Swimlane diagram for trade validation failure scenarios
