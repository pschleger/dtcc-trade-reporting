# Task: Create Detailed Event Documentation and Swimlane Diagrams

**Problem:** Document all incoming events and create comprehensive swimlane diagrams showing the flow of events through the system, including all involved entities and their interactions, to provide clear operational understanding of the system behavior.

Place the docs in the specification/dtcc-reporting/system-specification/events directory or appropriate sub-directories.


**Dependencies:** 7-Define-Detailed-External-Interface-Specifications

**Plan:**
1. Compile a comprehensive list of all incoming events from external interfaces
2. Document internal events generated by workflow transitions and processors
3. Create detailed event specifications including payload structure and metadata
4. Design swimlane diagrams for FpML trade confirmation processing flows
5. Design swimlane diagrams for position building and reconciliation flows
6. Design swimlane diagrams for regulatory reporting submission flows
7. Design swimlane diagrams for counterparty data management flows
8. Design swimlane diagrams for error handling and remediation flows
9. Show entity interactions and state changes in each swimlane diagram
10. Document event sequencing and timing requirements
11. Identify event correlation and causality relationships
12. Split documentation into multiple files if the event list becomes too large
13. Create event catalog with cross-references to workflows and entities
14. Validate event flows against use cases and business requirements

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Complete catalog of all incoming and internal events
- [ ] Detailed event specifications with payload structures
- [ ] Swimlane diagrams for all major business flows
- [ ] Entity interactions clearly shown in diagrams
- [ ] Event sequencing and timing documented
- [ ] Event correlation relationships identified
- [ ] Documentation split appropriately if too large
- [ ] Event catalog with cross-references created
- [ ] Validation against use cases completed
