# Task: Develop Detailed Functional Specifications for Workflow Components

**Problem:** Create comprehensive functional specifications for every processor and criterion defined in the workflow configurations, ensuring clear implementation guidance and business logic documentation for development teams.

**Dependencies:** 5-Create-Detailed-Workflow-Configurations

**Plan:**
1. Extract all unique processors and criteria from the Cyoda workflow configurations (compliant with WorkflowConfiguration.json schema)
2. Create functional specifications for Trade Confirmation processing criteria and processors
3. Create functional specifications for Position Management criteria and processors
4. Create functional specifications for Counterparty Data Management criteria and processors
5. Create functional specifications for Regulatory Reporting criteria and processors
6. Create functional specifications for Reference Data Management criteria and processors
7. Create functional specifications for Error Handling criteria and processors
8. Document input/output specifications for each component
9. Define business rules and validation logic for each component
10. Specify error handling and exception scenarios for each component
11. Document performance requirements and SLA expectations
12. Create component interaction diagrams showing data flow between processors
13. Ensure specifications align with Cyoda workflow schema requirements for criteria and processors
14. Validate specifications against business requirements and use cases

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Functional specification document for each unique processor
- [ ] Functional specification document for each unique criterion
- [ ] Input/output specifications clearly defined
- [ ] Business rules and validation logic documented
- [ ] Error handling scenarios specified
- [ ] Performance requirements established
