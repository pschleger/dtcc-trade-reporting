# Task: Design Position Management and Reconciliation Swimlane Diagrams

**Problem:** Create detailed swimlane diagrams showing position calculation, real-time position updates, reconciliation processes, and position reporting flows, including all entity interactions, timing dependencies, and error resolution procedures.

**Dependencies:** Task-8-1

**Plan:**
1. Analyze position management workflows and reconciliation processes
2. Identify all entities involved in position management (Position, Trade, ReconciliationResult)
3. Design swimlane diagram for real-time position calculation triggered by trade events
4. Document position aggregation and netting calculation flows
5. Design swimlane diagram for daily position reconciliation process
6. Show external position data retrieval and comparison flows
7. Document reconciliation break detection and tolerance rule application
8. Design swimlane diagram for reconciliation break investigation and resolution
9. Show position recalculation flows triggered by trade amendments
10. Document batch position processing and end-of-day procedures
11. Include timing dependencies and processing windows
12. Show escalation procedures for unresolved reconciliation breaks
13. Document position reporting threshold monitoring and alert generation
14. Include performance monitoring and SLA tracking flows
15. Validate diagrams against position management and reconciliation use cases

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Swimlane diagram for real-time position calculation from trade events
- [ ] Swimlane diagram for position aggregation and netting processes
- [ ] Swimlane diagram for daily position reconciliation process
