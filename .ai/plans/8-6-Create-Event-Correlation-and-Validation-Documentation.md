# Task: Create Event Correlation and Validation Documentation

**Problem:** Document event correlation patterns, causality relationships, timing dependencies, and create comprehensive validation of all event flows against business requirements and use cases to ensure complete system behavior understanding.

**Dependencies:** Task-8-2, Task-8-3, Task-8-4, Task-8-5

**Plan:**
1. Analyze all created swimlane diagrams to identify event correlation patterns
2. Document causality chains showing how events trigger subsequent events
3. Create event correlation matrix showing relationships between all event types
4. Document timing dependencies and sequencing requirements across workflows
5. Identify critical path events that impact regulatory compliance deadlines
6. Create event traceability documentation for audit and compliance purposes
7. Document event aggregation patterns for monitoring and reporting
8. Map events to business use cases and validate coverage completeness
9. Create cross-reference documentation linking events to entities and workflows
10. Document event-driven architecture patterns and best practices
11. Validate event flows against all business requirements and use cases
12. Create event troubleshooting guide for operational support
13. Document event monitoring and alerting requirements
14. Create event catalog navigation and search capabilities
15. Perform final validation of complete event documentation suite
