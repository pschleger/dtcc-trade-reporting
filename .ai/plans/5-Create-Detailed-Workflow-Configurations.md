# Task: Create Detailed Workflow Configurations

**Problem:** Transform the high-level workflow state machine designs into detailed Cyoda workflow JSON configurations that strictly comply with the [WorkflowConfiguration.json](../.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/schema/common/statemachine/conf/WorkflowConfiguration.json) schema, implementing all states, transitions, criteria, and processors required for the DTCC reporting system.

**Dependencies:** 4-Define-Detailed-Business-Entity-Schemas

**Plan:**
1. Create detailed workflow configuration for Trade Confirmation processing
2. Create detailed workflow configuration for Position Management and reconciliation
3. Create detailed workflow configuration for Counterparty Data Management
4. Create detailed workflow configuration for Regulatory Reporting submission
5. Create detailed workflow configuration for Reference Data Management
6. Create detailed workflow configuration for Error Handling and remediation
7. Define all criteria using "function" or "group" types (avoiding "simple" type as specified)
8. Define all processors with appropriate execution modes (SYNC/ASYNC)
9. Ensure proper use of manual vs automated transitions
10. Add process parameters using time UUIDs as specified in requirements
11. Validate workflow configurations against the [WorkflowConfiguration.json](../.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/schema/common/statemachine/conf/WorkflowConfiguration.json) schema
12. Create processParams blocks for each workflow configuration
13. Ensure all required schema fields are present (version, name, initialState, states)
14. Verify state names comply with schema naming rules (start with letter, alphanumeric/underscore/hyphen only)
15. Test workflow logic against the use cases defined in Task 2

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Complete workflow JSON files for all identified workflows
- [ ] All workflows strictly comply with [WorkflowConfiguration.json](../.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/schema/common/statemachine/conf/WorkflowConfiguration.json) schema
- [ ] All criteria use "function" or "group" types (no "simple" types)
- [ ] Process parameters use time UUIDs
- [ ] ProcessParams blocks included in all workflows
- [ ] Manual vs automated transitions properly configured
- [ ] Execution modes appropriately assigned to processors
- [ ] All required schema fields present (version, name, initialState, states)
- [ ] State names follow schema naming conventions
- [ ] Workflow configurations validate against [WorkflowConfiguration.json](../.ai/tasks/dtcc-reporting/schema/common/statemachine/conf/WorkflowConfiguration.json) schema
- [ ] All use cases from Task 2 are supported by the workflows
